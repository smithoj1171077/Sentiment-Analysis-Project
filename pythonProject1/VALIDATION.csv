0,33620,1.0," I was very satisfied with the care i got.

2,33626,1.0," Dr. Walkup is a patient doctor who gives his patients time to talk without interupting.  He is very knowedlegable about the medications available to many types of mental health disorders. Dr. Walkup will not push his patients (myself included) to take medications you may not feel comfortable with using...especially if taking other meds as well.  He is up-to-date with the latest research in the psychiatric field.  I have been a patient of Dr. Walkup for around 10 years, and have always been comfortable working with him to help me stay &quot;a happy me&quot; instead of living with depression/darkness/despair.  I hope this was helpful.  ",1
3,33626,1.0," Dr. Walkup has been very patient over the years and has never stopped seeking solutions. Finally, he recommended a vagus nerve stimulator after it came out for use for depression. It's taken awhile but I am doing better now and staying out of hospitals! Dr. Walkup is open-minded and innovative. He's a fine doctor.  ",1

6,33636,0.0," I had much better experience with Dr. Durant than a much more popular pediatric dentist in town. She was good, some of her office staff was new and didn't know some things, but was still helpful and didn't stop until she found the right answer.  ",1

13,33650,1.0," He is gracious, patient, courteous and if he doesn't know the answer to the problem, he will be the first to tell you.  I'm 68+ and love him as a doctor.  I TRUST HIM, and that is a very important element between doctor and patient.  ",1
14,33650,1.0," Dr. Wallace is a very kind, interested, and knowledgeable doctor.  I wish there were more physicians like him.  Some of his staff are rude and abrupt, but I called this to his attention and he took care of it. ",1
15,33654,0.0," I went to Dr Wadud as a new patient in June 2012. Dr Wadud did blood tests on me and suspected from my test results that I had hyperparathyroidism. After sending me for more blood tests, it was confirmed. I had had this disease for many years and previous doctors had missed it over and over again. I have since gone to Dr Norman in Tampa Fl for surgery and am cured. I will be forever grateful to Dr Wadud for her thoroughness &amp; exceptional knowledge.  ",1
16,33654,0.0," The woman who greets you is not friendly. Never smiles. Very abrupt. The nurse is fantastic. Dr. Wadud is fabulous! The wait time is terrible. Everyone in the waiting room complains. Never enough chairs to sit on in the main waiting room. Smoking is allowed right outside the door you have to enter. The nurse and Dr. Wadud are wonderful, they just need to replace the office staff. ",1
17,33659,1.0, The absolute rudest front desk staff I have ever encountered.  Once you get back to see the doctor it is fine but the office staff makes you really want to find another doctor. ,1
18,33659,1.0, Dr. Walker is a great family Dr and I highly recommend him.  I have been going to him for YEARS.  ,1
19,33659,1.0, I think alot of Dr. Walker and his staff. He has taken care of my parents and was there and informative when my dad had a massive stroke. Very compassiant man.  I will continue going to him until he retires which I hope he never does ,1
20,33659,1.0," I have gone to Dr. Walker for over 10 years and have been well cared for.  He does work at a fast pace, however has always had time to answer questions.  ",1
21,33659,1.0," Both of the times I've been to him, he gives medication in a 5-10 minute period, doesn't really examine, and then leaves without telling you what you have!  He actually leaves to write the prescription, and a nurse brings it in.   It has left me going hunh&#63; ",-1
22,33659,1.0, I believe Dr.  Walker is very compassionate and knowledgeable- I went in one day to talk about my elderly mom- I was upset - he sat and listened- NO CHARGE!- was quick to offer solutions to help me as a caregiver- got me the necessary home care we needed and referred us to a specialist who was just as wonderful! He's a general practioner and refers - if and when he finds it necessary! ,1
23,33659,1.0, the office manager  I think her name is shenell is very rude when ihad questions Bout my insurance.   No one wears name tags ,-1
24,33659,1.0," Poor excuse for a dr.  breezes in and out of exam room only to refer, refer, refer.  Spent less than 10 minutes w/me.   When I rec'd bill for $150.00 I thought this had to be an error.  Not at all, that's what he thinks 10 minutes of his time is worth.  Huge disappointment.  ",-1
25,33659,1.0," From the minute I walked in the office, I was treated with respect and kindness. Dr Walker does work at a faster pace than most other doctors I have been to, but he is very knowledgeable and helpful. You could not ask for a better doctor. ",1
26,33659,1.0," Seems like all he cares about is the money he gets for an office visit. When I went for my annual pre-mammogram, he refused to do a breast exam, saying I should get the mammogram first and then if they found anything, then he'd check. He just didn't want to waste the time when he could get in three more office visits in the same time. Also, he also prescribes just about anything you want. When my brother heard that, he went, seeking narcotics. My sister and I even warned him that our brother was an addict and begged him not to prescribe any narcotics, but he prescribed narcotics to him anyway. Needless to say, we found another doctor.  ",-1
27,33659,1.0," Dr. Walker was very dismissive with my condition.  Because he was so quick to shrug off my condition, I landed in the emergency room soon after.  All of which could have been avoided with proper basic medical attention.  ",-1
28,33662,1.0," Dr. Walker changed my life.  I was unable to function before I saw him.  I had been treated at the Diamond Headache Clinic and I still suffered from daily chronic headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches.  My pain is much more under control and I can function and experience daily events without worrying about my pain level.  :) ",1
29,33662,1.0," Excellant doctor, knowledgeable and good bedside manner. I went to 4 other neurologists in the Chas area, they were of Little or No help at all. Very good with diagnosis, and getting the facts and information needed. ",1
30,33662,1.0, Dr.Walker saved my daughters life.  She had been miss diagnosed by neurologist in Cola. SC Dr. Walker took the time to listen and believed in her. She was bed ridden for 21/2 years before we found him.  He diagnosed her on the first visit and was correct.  As her mother I will always be grateful for him.  I know Taryn would not be here today if we had not found him when we did. ,1
31,33662,1.0," Service and punctuality used to be bad, but it was great last time I went. I commented and he said they were really working on that. Love Dr. Walker. I've been seeing him for about 8 yrs for migraine and he has really helped me. Before him, I spent about 15 years going to roughly 6 doctors that treated me like a whiner. I was having about 15 migraines a month, which greatly affected my job and quality of life. Now I have 2 or 3. He made me feel emotionally better, like I at least had hope at the very first appointment. Even though we had to try allot of things to get where we are. But that's normal. He doesn't rush and it's an enjoyable visit, for having to go to the doctor.  ",1
32,33662,1.0, The staff is the worst imaginable. Walker did not find what was wrong with our daughter but a neurosurgeon did a neurological test and found the problem very quickly. We sat in a hotel room waiting for him or his office to call us with MRI results and instead of calling us (he knew we were waiting to hear the results) he left for a 2 week vacation. It took us 6 weeks to hear from him and he still didn't figure out the problem.  ,-1
33,33662,1.0, Super knowledgeable with a great bedside manner.  An expert in Psuedo Tumor Cerebri.  I was sick for 3 months and saw several doctors including another neurologist who failed to diagnosis or treat me correctly.  I am know sympton free and would highly recommend this doctor.  Is actually a neuro-opthalmologist which means he is an opthalmologist and neurologist.  He has just decided to specialize now in neurology.  ,1

38,33689,0.0, Dr. Wagner and staff were very cordial and helpfull.  I have never been rushed through a visit.  Dr. Wagner explained my treatment very well and I have been pleased with everything she has done for me.  I was taking far too many medications by my previous doctor and she is helping me get off of so many of them.  ,1

44,33708,1.0, Each time (4 visits) I waited about hour or more over the scheduled appt. time.  Did not take my  concern about med. side effects very seriously.  I did not feel he was listening very well as he said &quot;What&quot; very often and was very loud.  ,-1

53,33724,1.0,".  very arrogant, had to consult with nurse before making a diagnosis,his treatments did not help ",-1
54,33732,1.0," This doctor gives one word answers to queries about test results. When I was sent to Urgent Care after hours by the on-call Doctor for the practice, neither Dr.zwerner nor his staff called to follow-up. Since I couldn't get anything but one word answers, I obtained his notes about my visit and they claimed everything was normal even though I reported severe pain and the EKG was so abnormal he made the techs do it again because he thought they did it wrong (second result was the same as the first) and he then ordered extensive tests without any explanation of what the tests were looking for or why. I cannot recommend this doctor to anyone.  ",-1

77,33785,1.0," I was one of Dr. Anderson's dental professors when he was a student at the U of MN and I can say with unqualified candor that he was one of the finest and technically qualified students I have ever seen. It's impossible to comment on the comments listed on this site, but dentistry is incredibly complex and difficult at times. Open and respectful communication goes both ways and he was very well liked by his many patients at the U of MN, so I can't help but believe that a conversation with Dr. Anderson about a potential problem, especially if approached in a friendly manner, would result in a positive outcome for any patient that had a perceived problem with the office or treatment. As for the root canal problem, anyone can miss an extra canal, usually the size of a fraction of a human hair, and the important outcome seems to have been that the patient was referred to the proper specialist and the tooth, a portion of the patient's anatomy, was untimately saved. Dr. FJB, DDS, MA, CD ",1
78,33785,1.0, The physician screwed up my root canal by missing a fourth root on the x-ray (!) and then I had to have it redone.  Cost me a ton of extra money and pain.  ,-1

102,33871,1.0," While I also believe that Dr. Allard is a wonderful doctor, I do not appreciate that I always have to call him for my lab results. (They have never called me with the results-I always seem to get forgotten).  I would guess that this is because he has too large of a patient load.

You will never go to him and think you are just a number. If you see him out &amp; about he will greet you by name. He also has a great gift for listening and uses it with his amazing knowledge base to find what is wrong.  I can not stress this enough, HE FINDS WHAT IS WRONG AND FIXES IT!!  Even through my college years I would come home to see him as other doctors could never seem to pinpoint problems and fix them like he could. On another note, he always explains things to you in a manner you will understand.  When I was a child, he would show me my xrays and point out what was wrong and how he could tell.

Yet, there is a 15 minute late rule, if the patient is late!  My kids love going to see her, but I cannot afford to sit in a doctors office for 2 hours for an appointment that should only have 15 -20 minutes.  As for the staff, I have never had any issues with the staff.  They have always been able to answer my questions or accommodate my request.

198,34050,1.0," I am over 55, I felt he was  not ok however he was really quick to pass over my open wound that needed treatment. Told me to go home and wash with soap. This is why I came. The area around the wound turned dark, went to ER, as the infection had spread down my leg. Three weeks in hospital, two home with home health; gave me meds that made me see Jesus and the Angels.

I just cannot tell you in words how much he has done for me in the last two years over the past ten years of dealing with my health issue with other doctors.

I will forever go to him along with my family & friend's.  I HIGHLY recommend him to anyone with ortho problems!!! ",1

223,34075,1.0,"This doctor is a very good doctor.  He's always honest with you and doesn't sugarcoat a thing.  If he's unsure of what may be wrong or doesn't know the answer, he refers you on to a specialty doctor instead of just guessing.  I would recommend him to anyone!  He's been my doctor since birth and is now my son's pediatrician.  ",1
224,34076,0.0,"Dr.Gulbranson did a wonderful job! She seemed very knowledgeable and was easy to talk to. Her staff were very nice as well. Overall, I had a pleasant experience, and my eye sight was properly adjusted. I would not go to any other OD for my eye checkup.  ",1
225,34076,0.0,"Dr. Gulbranson is a God send! She is patient, kind, and upbeat with my three year old.  Because of her we have avoided the eye surgery our last doctor recommended and improved my daughters vision through eye therapy.   She is wonderful and we'll never go to anyone else again! ",1
226,34077,0.0,"This doctor has horrible bedside manner. He screamed at my husband on the phone when he couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. His nurse called back at 5 p.m. on a Friday when my husband was having another attack. She said there was nothing else they could do for him. We were forced to go to the local clinic, which pulled his hospital records and made an accurate diagnosis. It turns out that my husband has a rare syndrome, which Dr. Gross would have figured out if he did a little work (even the hospital radiologist knew what it was). I would never recommend this doctor to anyone I care about. ",-1

228,34079,1.0,"I had a surgery done with Dr. Peery and had a ton of complications. Dr. Peery had refused to see or treat me thinking I had nothing wrong with me. On my last attempt to correct my problems, Dr. Glatt had decided he wanted to look at me and my situation. He first asked me what I thought was wrong, and how I was feeling before he even started going into the possible complications I could be having. He was very respectful, listened carefully, and took his time. Within two weeks Dr. Glatt had not only found out what was wrong with me, but had it fixed, where as Dr. Peery wouldn't even give me the time of day. Dr. Glatt gets a 150% rating from me, because not only did he help me, but he cared for me. Kudos to Dr. Glatt for being the kind of doctor that not many are anymore. ",1
229,34079,1.0,"I found Dr. Glatt to be very professional and knowledgeable during my appointment.  On the other hand, I find myself disappointed with his insurance &quot;specialist&quot; Julie.  She is not thorough and seems unorganized.  I believe she hinders me more than helps.  If I didnt like the surgeon so much I would find another one due to her incompetence alone. ",1
230,34080,1.0,Unfortunately I had to have tooth extracted. Fortunately I had Dr. George. I have other medical conditions that make me a tricky patient to work with. He listened and took care of those special needs. The surgery was quick and painless. Recovery was ideal. I never needed pain meds after the surgery. It was just perfect care. ,1

236,34084,1.0,Dr. Gutnik is a very knowledgable doctor.  When you get his time it is valuable.  I am disappointed at times when I wait awhile only to get a few minutes of his time.  I am disappointed on the follow thru after tests.  Dr. Gutnik has your belief that he will find a solution only too feel dropped and not given enough information once the tests are in.  it would be good to have the tests first and then talk to him so you can get all your questions answered and good understand of his whole thought process.  ,1
237,34084,1.0,"Dr. Gutnik is as real as a doctor can get.  He really wants to help you, and that is very refreshing.  I have been a patient of his since 1980 and will continue as long as he is practicing medicine.  ",1

I was given and appt. with Dr. Gaetze and she was immediately rude the minute she walked into the examining rm. She spent very little time with me and told me I needed a complete hystarectomy immediately and had the signs of endomeitriosis.  She talked hurridly at just left with no care of the immense pain I was in.  I was having some problems before the op. and my husband called her office and explained, the receptionist then threatened to cancel my surgery, he asked for her nurst to call me which she did and she was insulting and threatened me twice to cancel the operation and would not answer my questions of the surgery. I fired her. Saw another OB/GYN and he said that there was no way I need this operation and that what is wrong with me is GI problem that is horrible.  This doctor calls herself a christion and a caring doctor but I implore you to get a second opinion. FOR SHAME ",-1

247,34086,0.0,Dr. Gaetze and her staff were very helpful and supportive when I had my miscarriage. Dr. Gaetze was there for me emotionally and professionally. She even hugged me before she left.

248,34086,0.0,She spent one hour on the phone in the room next to the exam room I was in - with her broker I believe from the sound of the conversation. She does not care to serve those beyond the child bearing years.  ,-1
249,34086,0.0,"Dr.Gaetze is notorious for making patients wait 1 to 1 1/2 hrs each visit. I don't know how many times I waited so long I wanted to cry. I've been told by one of her former nurses that she &quot;isn't a morning person&quot; and is always very late to work, pushing her schedule back.She is an abrasive woman. She did not make me feel like she really cared. She She did prescribe progesterone for me in early pregnancy, which I believed saved my pregnancy. I'm grateful for that. I had my son early, a morning which I was scheduled for a check up. Do you think Dr.Gaetze came to check in on me that day&#63; No. Not once my entire hospital stay. The nurses kept telling me she'd come, but never showed up. I saw her for a post partum check up and she talked about delivering my baby. Ha. I had to inform her she was mistaken, that dr. berdahl did that. To boot, she would not prescribe me birth control pills and pushed natural family planning on me. I, of course, switched doctors at this point. ",1
250,34086,0.0,"She saved my daughter's life as well as my own.  I don't know what I would have done without her. As stated before, her bedside manor isn't always great; however, what she lacks there is more than made up for by her knowledge, skill, and compassion.  She is a loving woman of God.  She is often late for appointments, but her staff does a great job keeping you informed when anything comes up.  I had a horrible pregnancy and delivery; however, Dr. G. was always there when I needed her.  She is truly a blessing sent by God!!!!!! ",1
251,34086,0.0,"Although I love Dr. Gaetze, I feel she has become so busy that her bedside manner has decreased in quality.

259,34094,0.0, You will not find a more thorough doctor than Dr. Hammell. He is concerned of your overall health not just your neck and back. He performed a thorough exam. His staff which is his wife is very nice and educated and experienced on insurance. She is also a certified chiropractic asst.He has a fully equipped clinic with x-rays.I can't say enough about this clinic. If you are on Interstate 90 stop in. You will get your money's worth.  ,1
260,34101,1.0," He brushed me in and out of his office, didn't explain my condition nor did he seem interested.  I found his bedside manner very chilly which would have been acceptable if he had been helpful, but he basically brushed me off, in a hurry to go elsewhere.  ",-1
261,34101,1.0, Could not adk for a more personal/caring doctor.  Feel most comfortable with him and his staff.  Lab work and procedures are explained completely and returns calls (or staff) in a swift manner. ,1

263,34101,1.0, Dr. Harvison is a very good Doctor.  He has a great 'bed side manner'.  He has a great sense of humor!  He listens and seems to care about his patients. I would recommend him very much! ,1
264,34102,1.0," Dr. Hajal seems to truly care about my sleep issues and my health and is working WITH me to find a solution.  Also, he has a great sense of humor, which I find most helpful.  I would definitely reccomend him to my friends. ",1
265,34102,1.0," dr rizan hajal didn't do anything except prescribe me a bunch of medication. keep in mind that i was 16 at the time, and i feel that i was way too young to be taking lunesta, ambien, every other sleeping pill under the roof, etc. would NEVER go back to him, ever.  ",-1

269,34107,2.0, Great Dr. ,1
270,34113,1.0, Dr. Hanley is awesome. I can really tell he cares about me and all aspects of my treatment. He is the best psychiatrist in the area. I have seen most others. His staff is tremendous as well.  He even makes personal telephone calls when warranted! ,1

Most definatley one of the best doctors ever.  Sioux Falls is so fortunate to have a quality physician like him! ",1
277,34132,1.0," Dr. Hart is a very courtious Dr. with very good bed side manners. He won't give up on you til he finds out whats wrong, even if he has to send you to a specilist. He's not affraid to say he doesn't know, BUT he will find out. He saved my mothers life. My adult family goes to him and is very satisified. Very knowledgeable man.

278,34145,2.0, The best orthopedic surgeon in Rapid City! Wouldn't go to anyone else. ,1
279,34152,1.0," Dr. Hansen is everything you would expect in a great doctor: very large depth of knowledge, very sharp to catch minor details that may lead to something bigger, and LISTENING to the patient! He is the single best doctor I have dealt with in my life (aside from the timeliness factor, but I understand he was overbooked because so many people trusted and were seeing him). If he were to enter FP again I would recommend him to anyone and everyone (he left active practice to pursue cosmetic medical interests). ",1
280,34152,1.0," This is an awesome doctor.  Until he left the sycamore and 4th ave practice.  He was our family doctor for many many years.  I thought he was awesome and he was good with my children.  Very respectful, courteous, once in awhile late.  I have major medical problems, spinal strokes and many other conditions.  I wish he was back in family practice because the doctor I got after him is the worst I have ever had.  ",1
281,34152,1.0," I saw him in Acute Care, he was very nice and knowledgeable both when I saw him and another time when my child saw him. He is a very caring doctor who figured out the problem and made sure all bases were covered, even making me go to the ER for an extra test. I was able to avoid hospitalization because he was so thorough and gave me an antibiotic shot right away, and he left my Acute Care visit notes with my regular doctor so he would know what was going on when I saw him the next day (I was told to make an appointment and tell them I had to be seen). He also explained things to me so I knew exactly what was going on. He is easy to talk to, also it is easy to ask him questions, as he is nice about answering them. He will go the extra mile to make sure that you are going to be okay.  ",1
282,34152,1.0, He spent extra time with me discussing my sons asthma. he was very knowledgable. ,1
283,34152,1.0, The man didn't seem to respect me or the field of medicine. ,-1

287,34162,1.0, Had to go to Sioux falls to get my arm repaired after Dr.  Harbert did surgery ,-1
288,34165,1.0," The best psychiatrist I've been to. He always, always asked me what I thought about my treatment, something psychiatrists seldom do. I felt in control and I wasn't prescribed medications I wasn't willing to take. He's professional and punctual, I was never left waiting and calls were returned promptly. He listened to all of my concerns and made suggestions, recommending other therapies when indicated.  I was his patient for two and a half years but then had to move with the Air Force. I wish I could move back to SD so I could see him again. Dr. Hamlyn raised the bar so high my current psychiatrist has yet to reach it. I would recommend him to anyone.  ",1
289,34170,2.0," Very private and confidential, felt at ease at all visits. Paid/Co-pay:$140",1
290,34174,1.0, Although I waited for a long time in the wait room and to see the doctor they spent over an hour and a half talking to me about my severe endometriosis treatment options. I have already been to 4 specialists and gone through 2 surgeries and 3 treatments for it. Only to have the pain return more severely each time. He was very patient and helpful with me and made me feel confident with the treatment we decided to try. The nurses and him also decided to do an ultrasound just to make sure everything was ok and found my IUD had slipped and was poking/causing pain. He immediately removed it and it felt a lot better. The whole visit was very comprehensive and productive. I would recommend him to anyone who needs a good specialist for endometriosis/pain problems and issues. I have a very complicated case also due to so much scarring and adhesions/lesions but he listened to everything I said and read all my past notes first before my appt! 2 thumbs up to Dr. Hansen! ,1
291,34174,1.0, I highly disagree that Dr. Hansen is a &quot;IVF salesman&quot;.  The clinic does alot work with patients before moving to IVF. If IVF is suggested its because they feel thats the right move for you. Time and money can be wasted with other procedures that are not nearly as effective as IVF. If they suggest IVF its because they have reviewed your chances and feel that is the best route possible for your situation. They have good rates and see alot of tough patients - that the docs in the cities dont or wont see. Dr. Hansen and his group are excellent. ,1
292,34174,1.0," Was told by Dr. Hansen and staff that my husband had no viable sperm at our initial visit. It was devastating to say the very least. He was referred to endocrinologist in s.f.'s, but never had an addtional sperm analysis. Upon the dx from Dr. H's office that my husband was azospermic, we decided to use donor sperm and tried 3 IUI cycles, all unsuccessful. After spending $15,000 with Dr. hansen's office we decided to try another clinic. The new clinic re examined my husbands sperm and found viable sperm. He was given a totally wrong dx by Dr. hansen's office. I am now 27 weeks pregnant with our first child. Yes, the money we wasted at Dr. H's office was significant, but not nearly as significant as the emtional turmoil we went through. In addtion, I probably saw Dr. Hansen himself for about 10 min total throughout my year long treatment at his clinic. His PA Tammi did all my consults and IUIs. Helpful staff. Paid/Co-pay:$15000",-1
293,34174,1.0," After getting nowhere with my regular ob/gyn I decided to see Dr.Hansen. He ran better tests, had greater advice and we discovered a cyst during the dye test I never knew I had. He removed it during same day surgery, he was very excited at our chances to conceive now and I appreciate his upbeat attitude and helpfulness. So much better than my other dr who was such a downer. All the staff has been great to work with. And Dr.Hansen is a blessing.  ",1
294,34174,1.0," I am currently a patient with Dr. Hansen. This is my 3rd round of IVF. The first two didn't work and I'm waiting for my results of the 3rd. I must say, even though we haven't yet achieved a pregnancy, Dr. Hansen and his nurses never lost hope in us. They are very understanding and helpful. My only complant is that each time I go, I see Dr. Hansen less and less. But the nurses are WONDERFUL!!! They take the time to know you by name and they treat you like family. I am happy with my decision to go to Dr. Hansen.  ",1
295,34174,1.0," If it weren't for Dr. Hansen and his staff, I wouldn't have the 2 wonderful kids that I have in my life today.  Dr. Hansen, his PA, and his staff were very knowledgable and helpful.  The only problem that I had with his staff, was the billing portion of it, I was charged for something I never should have been charged for, and that took almost a year to get resolved. ",1
296,34174,1.0," Dr Hansen has been a great help to my husband and I.  Thanks to him we have a family.  If I had questions he would take the time to sit and answer them.  A VERY nice, gentle,wonderful Doctor! ",1
297,34174,1.0, VERY IMPRESSED with his staff. He is a WONDERFUL man and doctor. ,1
298,34174,1.0," Our daughter would not be here today without the help of Dr. Hansen and his treatment team.  After multiple pregnancy losses, my husband and I were close to giving up hope.  We feared that our dream of parenthood would not be a reality for us.  Dr. Hansen took the time to complete a thorough evaluation and went through all of our options.  His approach is conservative, with the ultimate goal of achieving a healthy, singleton pregnancy.  His staff is very well organized.  Everyone took the time to understand our history and personal circumstances.  We were nervous about the IVF procedure, but the entire process was much easier than we ever anticipated.  Every step was closely monitored, and adjustments were made every day to tailor the treatment based on how my body was responding.  His services are invaluable to the residents of South Dakota, and we would not have our family today without him.  ",1
299,34174,1.0," Went in for a same-day surgery to remove fallopian tube. Hansen recommended laparoscopy. I signed a form advising Hansen to STOP if he encountered any scar tissue & cut me open instead so he could see where he was cutting. I have severe internal scarring, which he was fully aware of. He encountered major scarring, but continued to cut and knicked my bowel. He admitted to TRAUMA SURGEON that he continued through a wall of scar tissue. Hansen sent me home after the surgery. The next morning after a painful, sleepless night of several phone calls to Hansen, he tells me I was just not tolerating the pain well. I was vomiting every time I took pain med or a sip of water & couldn't keep anything down. He suggested I wait until his clinic opened to come in.  Went in that a.m. Two days later, being fed anti-nausea & pain meds in the hospital instead of finding out what the cause was, the nurse stood me up & bowel contents poured from my surgical wounds. Dr. Timmerman BARELY saved my life...  ",-1
300,34174,1.0," I wasted $4,000 for an IUI that never happened do to lack of blood test and irresponsible nurses. I called in told the nurse I was ovulating and she said that was normal with Repronex two days later I had an ultrasound and the eggs vanished. They later told me I surged and I could have the IUI because I would be charged. I went in the day of the IUI and his other nurse said that Tammi was wrong I would not of been charged but by that time the donor sperm was unthawed. Another $550 lost and over $1,200 in medicine. Paid/Co-pay:$4000",-1
301,34174,1.0, He definitely takes the time to sit down and get to know your situation before discussing options - never made me feel rushed.   Would definitely recommend him! ,1
302,34174,1.0, he was very nice and helpfull everytime i went in but i didnt always  get to see him like i should have.  ,1
303,34174,1.0, Dr. Hansen and his staff are wonderful! Very compassionate and caring. I would recommend them to anyone. I even got a call from Dr. Hansen on a Saturday after a particularly grim diagnosis regarding my fertility issues.  ,1
304,34175,0.0, Dr. Halligan is very intelligent and helpful.  When I saw her I got the following impressions.  She seems to look at the whole patient and works to help people live better.  She considers all angles of the problem and takes time to really listen.  She answered all my questions well. ,1
305,34178,1.0, I spent a fraction of what I was supposed to have done medically with drugs and surgery! Dr. Mark Hagen is very gifted doctor who cares and loves his patients! he has a great staff also that are very friendly and knowledgeable! Paid/Co-pay:$1500,1
306,34178,1.0, he really helped me with my auto accident and carpal tunnel! His staff is very friendly and helpful. Dr. Mark has also done a few missionary trips to Kenya to take care of the poor. He his a very compassionate and trustworthy Doctor! ,1
307,34183,1.0, Doesn't seem to care.  Very cavalier in attitude.  Not remotely inquisitive.  Can't remember my name despite several visits.  Never offers advice.  Just goes through the motions and collects his fees. ,-1
308,34191,1.0," Dr. Ingraham was extremely knowledgable &amp; considering the situation we were in, extremely caring. ",1
309,34191,1.0," Dr. Ingraham saw me in the hospital after a ruptured brain aneurysm.  He was in TN at the time.  He was very nice and always brought a smile on my face.  He is since practicing in South Dakota.  I wish he were still here because if I ever need brain surgery I would trust him to do it.  I have recovered fully from my ruptured brain aneurysm.  Dr. Ingraham checked on me several times in the hospital.  He did not perform surgery on me because coiling was chosen as being the best option in my case.

When he first met my daughter, he noticed this spot on her ear that I had asked doctors about in the past (with no answers), and he immediately asked if she had kidney problems (she did) and started explaining how that little mark can indicate a kidney problem. If we had him back when our daughter was a baby, maybe it wouldn't have taken a huge infection for doctors to find the kidney problem!! That same child Dr. Krell felt was autistic (about a year later) and while I didn't believe it (and neither did the birth-to-three professionals at the time), time has proven us all wrong and Dr. Krell correct. My now-five year old daughter is fully autistic, limited speech and unable to communicate even basic needs. So, he saw it at 2, the rest of us saw it at 4.

We cannot recommend her enough and look forward to having her as our doctor again should we have another child in the future. ",1

431,34251,1.0,good guy ,1
432,34252,1.0,Dr Kooima has been our Ped for all 5 of our children.  He is so patient and considerate with us.  He is extremely gentle and our kids absolutely love him.  He respects our requests not to use antibiotics unless absolutely necessary and is open to trying alternative methods of treatment.  We are blessed to have such a wonderful pediatrician. ,1
433,34252,1.0,"Is wonderful with my son and treats me with respect as a single-mom; my son loves him and is not scared of going to the doctor's office. But, on the other hand, he is VERY conservative when it comes to treating certain illnesses or performing certain studies to get a diagnosis.  ",1
434,34252,1.0,"Very good with my kids.  Calm, reasonable, talks directly to the kids and they love him ",1
435,34271,1.0," Very thorough, spent lots of time with me and really explainded things well.  ",1
436,34271,1.0, Wonderful doctor! Very compentent and caring. Great staff. I would recomend Dr. Lawlor for back pain. He has given me back a much better quality of life.  ,1
437,34272,1.0, Very Friendly and explained exactly what he was doing during each step on my root canal.  This was my first one and I was pretty nervous about it.  I can honestly say that other than the novocain injections I felt absolutley no pain!  I will definately return to this doctor if the need arises for me again in the future.  ,1
438,34272,1.0, Greeted warmly by the staff.  The Dr. spent a considerable amount of time explaining the evalulation and treatment.  The procedure was to my surprise abslolutely nothing to worry about.  I can't thank them enough and would strongly recommend them to anyone. ,1
439,34272,1.0," This guy and his staff are top notch. I was in his office today for a root canal and his staff immediately set me at ease. He was in to see me within about 3 minutes of me sitting in the cair. He explained everything he was doing as he did the work and told me what to expect at each point. He even followed up with a call from his personal home number that evening leaving info so I could call him at home if I felt discomfort or pain. The dentist who referred me to him also could not say enough about how good the quality of work he performs and after having absolutely zero discomfort I can attest this is true. I'm not sure what the previous person requested or extperiences, but I was able to get in 6 days after calling for an appointment. True the next available appointment was 3 weeks later if i was not available for the one I set, but the alternative would be for them to keep unnecessary openings and raise costs for everyone.  ",1

445,34281,1.0," He was very compasionate and understanding! We came in at about 1:30am and he never made us feel as if he were burden or tired, he is a very nice young man.  ",1
446,34284,1.0, Top of the line all around.  Early detection of my prostate cancer that most doctors would not have caught. My PSA went from 1.27 to 2.27 in one year which is still fairly low but because of the big % increase he referred me for further tests. ,1
447,34284,1.0, Dr. Larson is the least judgmental doctor I have ever had. He listens without scolding and gives advice without preaching. Plus he's a nice guy! ,1
448,34292,1.0, Great Dr. he delivered my kids and was great.  He is very carring ,1
449,34300,1.0, Dr. Lavin is by the best dentist I have seen. He is very friendly and caring. You can tell he concerned about his patients and it shows in his work. I was very please with his entire staff- everyone I spoke to was helpful and caring. I am very impressed.  ,1

451,34300,1.0," If any friend, family member, or acquaintance were seeking a periodontist; I would highly recommend Dr. Mark Lavin in Sioux Falls. I have sat in many dental chairs in my 65 yrs, and I have never been more pleased with my care than I have been with Dr. Lavin. If there is a perfect periodontist, it would definitely be Dr. Lavin. The overall experience(including office &amp; staff) has been a total pleaure. ",1
452,34300,1.0," Dr. Lavin is fantastic!!! He definitely loves what he does and cares about his patients.  i was very nervous to go see him, but he and his staff immediately put me at ease and treated me kind and courteously.  I recommend him 100 times over!  Thanks Dr.  Mark ",1
453,34301,0.0," Very knowlegable dentist. She explained my treatment plan in details and listened to me when expressing my concerns. Needed crowns done and wanted the work finished before my daughter's wedding. Dr Latinow did amazing job. In addition, it was absolutely painless and I had a back massage during the treatment. Prior visiting her office I had a severe dental fear but evewr since I am a regular and complient patient.Great personality and sense of humor. The staff is very friendly.  ",1
454,34302,1.0," He hurt my back worse than it was already. He snapped my neck back in place, but he doesn't have an adjuster for ur actual spine, just seems to hope twisting ur legs a different way and putting weight on it will help. I have been to chiropractors before, I haven't seen one with as great a knowledge of anatomy and no practical way of applying it before in my life.... Don't go there.... U can get better care for free by having a friend step on ur back at home ",-1
455,34302,1.0, Dan and his brother Robin are the best. You can always get in and they are so good at listening and helping you.  ,1
456,34308,2.0, Dr Liedtke is kind and caring and takes the time to explain things to us and answer our questions. ,1
457,34310,0.0, I have never met Dr Landeen until the day I had my induction.  She just happened to be the Dr that was working that day.  I had a full placenta abruption while she was checking up on me in my room.  She had me from the room to the operating room with my baby delivered in under 3 minutes.  My baby probably only had another minute to spare.  She saved his life &amp; my life.  She was a miracle in an emergency situation.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Landeen to anyone.  ,1
458,34310,0.0," This is the BEST doctor anyone could ask for.  She is caring, smart, and reassuring.  I can't say enough good about her!!!! ",1
459,34310,0.0," Dr Landeen was my first baby's doctor and it was an AMAZING experience. No other doctor has been able to compare with her for me. However there is a ton of wait time at the appointment but when you finally see her it is worth it. One thing that i found different with her, when you are talking to her, she isnt writing down notes, she looks at you and  LISTENS and then responds. And in the next appointment, she comes prepared and remembers all that you told her. It made me feel like i was a important patient to her, not just a number and i am sure all her patients do. ",1
460,34310,0.0," Laurie made me feel completely at ease. I went in to her after seeing 5 other doctors, I was beginning to think I was making it up in my head.

461,34310,0.0," She's a very warm, patient, knowledgeable doctor!  She's willing to spend the extra time needed to answer all your questions.  ",1
462,34310,0.0," I was very comfortable with her. I felt like I could be myself. (I can be brutally honest and crude.) She never once made me feel inferior, like a lot of dr can. Her punctuality could be much better, but I beleive that the reason she seems to run behind is because she actually spends time with you. She doesn't just come in, do her thing and leave. She gives you plenty of time for questions and doesn't make you feel like an idiot for asking stupid questions. You actually feel like you are the only patient that matters. She has the type of personality that can get along with anyone. I would recommend her to anyone.  ",1
463,34311,2.0, So Far so good.  Still in the first trimester but Lindbloom has made both me and my husband very comfortable ,1
464,34324,0.0," What a wonderful, skilled Doctor!  She has been our ENT for 26 years.  She put tubes in 2 of my 5 children, has put tubes in my 1 yr old grandson, removed my 3 year old grandson's tonsils and is now going to remove a thyroglossal duct cyst from my 2 year old granddaughter.  I wouldn't trust another ENT.  She is AWESOME! ",1
465,34324,0.0," Our family holds Dr. Laura Larsen in very high regards.  She has been all three of my children's ENT, my husbands ENT and my own.  We have been very happy with the service and the outcome of all the procedures she performed.  The thing that stands out the most in our minds is this story....one year ago our 25 year old son was in ICU at Avera McKennan following complications from a Stem Cell Transplant and when she came through the ICU to visit a patient and seen our family in the waiting area late at night, she stopped for a visit.  The next day she came back to the ICU and made the offer for my husband and I and our son's wife to stay in their home while we were having to live in Sioux Falls.  How many Dr.'s would go that extra mile...she has a tremendous heart and when our son passed away several weeks later, we received a card from her; she was very compassionate!  She has earned an A+ in our book.  ",1
466,34324,0.0," She is down to earth, very knowledgeable, caring Doctor who helped my son.  He suffered delayed learning due to ear problems he was 3 years old.  She corrected the problem and now he is 15 years old and a straight A student excelling.  Thank You Dr Laura Larsen ",1
467,34324,0.0, Dr. Larsen is very helpful and kind and answered all my questions.  I recommend her to anyone.  She told me exactly what was going on with my chil's ears when previous M.D.'s did not. ,1
468,34324,0.0," great ENT, needs to stick to ENT.  Needs to stay away from allergy testing.  Staff blew off delayed reaction to testing as insignificant.  With immediate testing reaction did not give any direction on how to address allergy shown.  lacked follow through on results and no referral to specialists to help me.  went back to primary doctor and was referred to an allergy specialist.  Ended up seeing another doctor to resolve issues with good success.  Feel that I wasted my time and our insurance company's money with them.  ",-1
469,34330,1.0, Dr. Larson has been our family doctor since 1994.  He has been with us through losses and the joys of delivering our son and the every day illnesses that families encounter.  He listens well and does not have a problem recommending other specialists when it is beyond his scope.  Dr. Larson is a Christian and (for our family) this puts us on the 'same page' in terms of how we view life in general.  Super doc! ,1
470,34335,2.0,.  Excellent Doctor ,1
471,34336,1.0, Office visit lasted less than 5 minutes. Told me the problem with my wrist and told me I could read about it on the internet. No contact with my wife in waiting room after surgery. Has no bedside manor. Treats patients as if it is an assembly line factory.  ,-1
472,34336,1.0," I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.  He was o.k. at the initial visit at the hospital before surgery, however, after that, his health care/concern deteriorated considerably.  His office visits were less than 5 min., there was no after surgery followup/instructions after a difficult shoulder surgery, as far as how to dress/undress, pain mgmt., etc. &amp; later afterwards when I developed pneumonia and he was requested to come by the hospital to see me, .... he never even bothered to show up.  I later found out that the surgery was mishandled, .. should have put in a prosthetic humerus bone instead of trying to repair one that was completely crushed and which now has developed avascular necrosis and the complete surgery has to be redone, and this time not only the humerus bone needing to be replaced, but a total shoulder replacement due to the botched up job and disfiguration from the original surgery.  Very disappointing.  ",-1
473,34336,1.0," Very helpful, he came in answered all the questions i had really well and he got things done very efficiently. ",1
474,34336,1.0, Pleasant and to the point.  Answered questions fully.  Explained surgical procedures to be performed and options.  Knew what he was talking about.  Would recommend him. ,1
475,34336,1.0," Not the warmest bedside manner, but the guy was an artist with a detached ligament in my wrist--he did a procedure that has kept my hand and wrist functioning as well as my other hand and wrist. So he isn't Mr. Rogers--he did a fabulous job for me.  ",1
476,34336,1.0, Spent maybe 4-5 minutes with patient. NO bedside manner whatsoever.  No instructions for after surgery.  Hard to reach. ,-1
477,34336,1.0," He diagnosed the problem with my hand after 2 other doctors couldn't. He didn't give detailed information about what to expect after surgary. When called his office with questions, they didn't always return calls in a timely manner. ",1

482,34359,1.0," Doctor was very knowledgeable in my father's care. He took time to discuss with my father -testing, health concerns and answered all questions we had.

484,34366,0.0," I've known Linda Peterson for 24 years now. She delivered both of my boys. I would wait hours for her because I knew if she wasn't with me at my appointment that she was doing her best to bring a healthy child into the world somewhere. My youngest born 7 weeks early. She did amazing! I would have never done anything diff if given the chance. Seven years later she performed a colposcopy. Not sure on that spelling! I showed signs of cancerous cells. I've had my regular checks, and everything has been great so far until the last cpl months. I'm not feeling so good again. I haven't seen her in a cpl years, but there's no one else I would rather have at my side to do this again. Today I made another appointment with her. I'll be driving 3 hours to see her! She is worth your time over and over! God Bless the good women. ",1
485,34373,0.0,".  Dentist is fine, her scheduling staff very inconsiderate--just change your appt time whenver they feel like it and tell you when the call the day before your appt to remind you of it--even though you have a card written by them with the appt time on it--this happens 9 out of 10 appointments!! I guess they feel their time is more important than anyone elses ",1
486,34374,2.0," Been my family Dr for years now.  Always has been supportive, knowledgable, willing to share information and overall, a great guy to go see when you have to. ",1
487,34374,2.0," The staff is excellent.  Very prompt.  Doctor is very helpful and knowledgeable.  Only weak point I believe is lack of follow-up for patient condition.  Otherwise, very, very good. ",1
488,34374,2.0, Very knowledgeable and caring.  Good listening skills.  Willing to refer when needed.  Nurses (Jackie and Christine) are kind and helpful.  My only complaint would be that Barb and Julie (front desk) are borderline rude.  The receptionist I usually talk to (Peggy) is great! ,1

497,34393,1.0," Dr. Papendick is one of the finest doctors I have encountred in my life.  He is knowledgeable and keeps up with emerging treds in his speciality.  He has operated on me twice with excellent results and I have sen him numerous other times for exams and injections. He listens well and snswers every question.  One does not feel as if he is rushing off to see another patient.  He also has a winning personality and a fine sense of humor.  Both are qualities that are important when one is not feeling well.  He also has devoted countless hours voluntarily to students in Rapid City, who participate in sports.  An outstanding physician in the best bone clinic in the Black HIlls area. ",1

501,34398,1.0, Wouldn't help with complications after vasectomy.  Finally had to see urologist.  Was told that urologist has seen many of his patients.  Procedure was amazingly painfull (was told this is not typical).  He is probably an all right doctor as long as you don't require any follow up care.  Definitely do not get a vasectomy from him - go to a urologist. ,-1

509,34413,0.0," I have been going to Dr. Peters for 22 years.  She is caring,a good listener, non-judgemental and very knowledgeable.  I am sorry to hear she is going part-time, but impressed that she is bringing a woman doctor who studied in South Dakota into her practice. ",1
510,34413,0.0," Dr. Peters is always very friendly and open to listening to her patients. I've never felt rushed, like she was in a hurry to get to another patient. She is not one to push medication if you're unsure about their necessity, and she's willing to hear you out on interest in natural remedies. Phone calls are handled by one of her nurses - they take your question and call you back (very promtly) with her answers. She was my doctor before my first child, and I love her so much that I will stay with her for all my children's pregnancies/births/well-child care as long as we're in the area and she's still practicing.

516,34426,1.0," I had to have a tumor removed on my face about a year ago. After it was removed, I thought the incision might be infected. Pay says my whole face is infected. I ask if the incision is also infected. He says, &quot;What I'm telling you is your whole face is infected.&quot; Then he gives me a few free samples. One was a topical steroid, although I didn't know that at the time. I have taken steroids before and explained to Pay how much I disliked them, that they caused all sorts of problems for me and that I would never use steroids again. He obviously wasn't listening. I thought what he gave me was to get rid of an infection; he didn't say it was for the minor and temporary redness from Retin-A, which I was using because of the steroids I was put on before. The steroid permanently ruined my skin. Besides that, steroids like the one I was given are contraindicated for infections, so it was stupid that he was prescribing it if he really thought my whole skin was infected with staph infection.  ",-1
517,34426,1.0," My skin is permanently scarred, ruined, as a result of going to this dermatologist. I wish I could just get my skin to look like what it did before I went to this &quot;doctor.&quot;  Unfortunately, however, that's impossible. ",-1
518,34426,1.0," He scarred my face. There's no possible way to fix the damage he caused. Also, he's very rude and doesn't even care that he scarred my face. Now being in a major city, visiting a friend, I have had the opportunity to go to a good doctor, a graduate of Columbia. He laughed and ridiculed the idea that what Pay did to my face could be dermatitis. He said it's obviously significant scarring and it's permanent. He said he could try using a laser treatment, which is expensive, but the effect would be marginal and insignificant. What a waste. It's unreal to go to a dermatologist and to have your face scarred for the rest of your life. ",-1

523,34441,1.0," When I called to make an appointment to see Dr. Peery I asked specifically if he would be able to diagnose a condition that another Doctor was suspicious of; I was assured that he could (otherwise I wouldn't have made the appointment). A couple days prior to my appt, I received a call from his office seeking prior history information and the woman on the line laughed at me when I shared personal information about my pain and what it felt like - that was not very professional! After check-in I waited over 90 minutes before I actually saw Doctor Peery in an exam room. He immediately threw his hands in the air and explained there was nothing he could do for me and didn't have any knowledge about how to diagnose the suspected condition. This was a complete waste of time with an incompetent and insensitive staff and doctor.  ",-1
524,34442,1.0," This fantastic doctor works as a hospitalist only. I'm an RN and have worked with many docs through the years, and he is BY FAR the most knowledgable and the most thorough doctor I've ever worked with. He's the bomb!!

527,34443,0.0, She was very knowledegable but made me feel uncomfortable. She made me feel bad and I've never been back to her. ,1
528,34443,0.0," Very nice! Made me feel comfortable. Researches for patients, even when other drs have diagnosed - she will still put time in to make sure that is what's wrong. I trust her. She has a great and also very kind physician's assistant or nurse (I'm not really sure) Colleen who always calls back the same day and also goes out of her way to help with insurance and/or pharmacy problems. Can't recommend highly enough and I've been to many doctors in my life.  ",1
529,34445,0.0,my daughter got hurt and dr swift told me that she didn't need surgery - got a second opinion and he said she needed to.  I am glad we listed to the other doctor or she would have had some serious issues.  This was the third child he turned away for surgery when after second opinions they needed it after all. ,-1
530,34446,1.0,"Dr asked what my expectations were from surgery. I wanted to run, bike and swim. Dr Shumaker said this would be a reasonable goal. Prior to surgery I was getting epidurals and was doing all three. At first follow up after surgery I asked when I could start running. His response was that I could never run again (I had a fusion done on lower back) He was right about that. After 18 month healing time spasms returned and have not had a pain free day since.   As a bonus I had a blood clot 2 weeks after surgery which the good doctor would not see me for as &quot;the surgery could not possibly have caused&quot;    Bottom line in my opinion this doctor may be good surgeon but he is definitely not interested in following up after the fee is collected ",-1
531,34446,1.0,"Not helpful when you need answers. Does not pick up the phone, leaves you hanging. He'll be there to cut though, after that he's done with you.I think he's a good dr, but only in the OR. ",-1
532,34446,1.0,"This man ****ed my back, having my 4th surgery be a SPINAL FUSION at the age of only 22!!  I am now permanently screwed, litterally.

535,34447,1.0,"I don't what to say but WOW!  I have always had a very hard time dealing with a chronic illness.  Dr. Sorensen seems to understand better than most has has so helpful and easy to talk to.  He always takes the time to listen and doesn't get impatient when I start to freak out.  He is alway very courteous and willing to work with me to keep me as healthy as possible.   I just can't enough good things about him, except for thank you so much! ",1
536,34447,1.0,I happen to think that Todd Sorenson is one of the best doctors. My two kids trust him very much and he is in fact the only doctor that they do trust.  ,1
537,34447,1.0,Dr. Sorensen is one of the best family physicians I have ever received care from. He truly cares about the patient as a whole. He recognizes that medicine is multi-faceted. He takes time to ask questions and he listens!  When seeing his patients for physical illness he also recognizes the mental/emotional dynamics that go along with chronic illness. As a family physician he is attentive to how the other members of the family are impacted by chronic illness of a family member. Dr. Sorensen's bedside manner is great and he puts his patients at ease. He is positive and reassuring which makes a big difference when a loved one is facing a long-term illness. He is sensitive to the financial burden medications place on family budgets and is willing to assist with filling out necessary forms in order to get the medications. When I or other of my family is sick we are willing to wait for an available appointment with Dr. Sorenesen. Only an real man of God could provide such attentive care.  ,1
538,34447,1.0,Dr. Sorensen does more than figure out what is wrong and prescribe a medicine. He takes time to answer questions in a thorough manner. When I was admitted to the hospital he told me he would come see me as soon as he was done for the day. Dr. Sorensen is not just concerned with getting the job done and moving on to the next patient. He is personal and compassionate. I would recommend him to anyone.  :) ,1
539,34447,1.0,Dr. Sorensen is very thourough. He takes time to answer any questions you may have and he listens to what you have to say. He knows his patients and he works very hard to work you in if you need to be seen. He is great with my daugther who is 14 months old and has been her doctor since before she was born. He is gentle and does not rush you out the door. His nurses are very personable and are usually very good about calling right back if you leave a message. I have absolutely no complaints about Dr. Sorensen and would recommend him to anyone! ,1
540,34447,1.0,"I rated Dr Sorenson the way I did because he is very knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. He is easy to talk to and answers any and all questions I have for him at my appointments or whenever I call his office. He is knowledgeable in such a wide variety of ways. His nurses are also wonderful and so friendly and helpful. I would recommend him very highly. ",1

547,34450,0.0,"I had just moved ito town and called the clinic to setup a new appt.They assigned me to Dr.Smith and she was pleasant at first meeting. However everything that I wanted to talk to her about she told me to not worry so much that she's had these symptoms before too, etc. She totally downplayed what I was bringing to her attention. She ordered labs, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I setup another appointment to see her less than 2 months later and I waited over an hour to meet with her. When she finally came in the room it was very very brief. She prescribed me meds for my thyroid and being newly diagnosed with this condition I had questions about it and the meds. I said &quot;May I ask you a couple questions&quot; and she said &quot;No, I don't have time for questions today. You need to schedule another appointment for that.&quot; I was FURIOUS. I rescheduled alright, but not with her. I left feeling like this was about money. ",-1

550,34452,1.0,Is old school but knows his stuff. Obviously cares greatly about his patients. ,1
551,34452,1.0,He has a wonderful bedside manner but does like to talk down to you. Doesn't take the time to really listen at times he seems to be arrogant. His staff acts like they are afraid to ask him anything. I seen him berate one of his nurses when he didn't think anyone was watching. I don't have any plans on going to him again.  ,1
552,34453,1.0,"I had at least 3 headaches a week for years. Now they are gone. I couldnt be happier. It was a bit of a pain scheduling at his old office since it was just him and i put up with it because he was helping me, but his new office location is more convenient for me and his staff is very very helpful. Highly recommended. ",1

559,34454,1.0,terrific; very compassionate. Only Doc that is willing and able to work with Chiropractors and other specialists. Always keeps my interest the right and center.  We are fortunate to ahve him in Sioux falls ,1
560,34454,1.0,Husband saw dr.be careful with this guy.he charged us for a follow up call when he had told us he wpould call with results. Results were 2 months late. When asked for records they where never sent. This is true about not able to go to other facilities. The nurses at sioux falls surgical center have also had issues. Will not go to this man again.  ,-1
561,34454,1.0,"After seeing many doctors and no one could find out what was wrong with me, he realized I have celiac disease.  I'm allergic to wheat etc!  I lost a lot of weight over the years without trying and I had severe pain.  He did a colonscopy and endoscopy at the Surgical Center and did a biopsy.  I did not have any complications.  I am pleased with him overall.  His staff is helpful.  He does run far behind schedule.  The biopsy report that I got a copy of said there was a portion of the biopsy that was not easily identified and was not what the dr thought it was.  He does suggest more of the same tests but when I asked to wait since I'm doing so well, he was fine with my decision.  I continue to be his patient because he found the problem when so many other could not including Mayo Clinic.  ",1
562,34454,1.0,"As stated below, this physician does not have privileges at Avera McKennan or Sanford; only the Surgical Center. After only one office visit, I knew this physician was not for me. He wanted to instantly yank me off all medications I was on and admit me to the Surgical Center as he knew I'd have complications from doing so. Then, also stated below, if there was an emergency I'd have to be taken to one of the other hospitals and see their doctors. This doctor is way too radical. I will never go to him again and I don't refer any one to him either.  ",-1
563,34454,1.0,This doctor has lost hospital privileges at Sanford and McKennan Hospitals.  He also was fired from the VA.  If you have complications from a procedure of his at the Sioux Falls Surgery Center (the only place in Sioux Falls that allows him to do procedures) you have to be tranfered to McKennan Hospital and be seen by their gastroenterologists in the ER.  If you had a good outcome with this doctor then you were one of the lucky few.  ,-1
564,34454,1.0,After going to numerous doctors for 2 1/2 years I went to Dr. Singaram and he finally figured out what was wrong with me. He spent alot of time with me and was very very helpful and very sympathetic.  ,1
565,34455,1.0,Told me all my back x-ray said to him was how old I was. Later that month a back surgeon showed me a lot with same x-ray and I did have numerous problems with my spine and did have surgery. Doing well now. I would not recommend Dr. Seibel to anyone! ,-1
566,34455,1.0,He told me arthritis was &quot;to be expected&quot; as i WAS &quot;on the other side of 50&quot; Very condescending and poor bedside manner ,-1
567,34455,1.0,He went out of his way to be kind and helpful during a difficult time in our lives. His excellent skills and caring made all the difference in a frightening and confusing situation. A doctor reaching out over and above his duty is truly appreciated! ,1

I have asked & asked for advice and information regarding my wife's illness with little success. I do not in any way believe this is unique to Dr. Schindler - but a reflection on the medical industry times we live in. I have so little medical knowledge, the Net offers to much to filter down to my specific questions - wish Dr. Schindler could be messaged, and, eventually respond to, very worried caregivers to his patients.

582,34459,1.0,"I had a concussion from an accident on Christmas day.  Dr. Schindler was very skilled, thorough, complete and had excellent bed-side manner.  I remember little about the actual accident. I do, however, remember Dr. Schindler spent time with me and my family explaining what had happend and was there through-out the entire process,explaining everything in a manner that we could understand. Even though it was Christmas, he took the time to sit down with us and answer all of our questions.  He never seemed bothered by our questions or the time we took. It is amazing that a neurosurgeon could put such a complicated process into such understandable terms. I recommend him to everyone.  I feel very fortunate to have him for my doctor.  I strongly believe that he was placed there for me at the right time and the right place.  ",1
583,34459,1.0,Very rude doctor. Left our daughter in a hallway after surgery and did not provide post-surgical contact. Unsatisfactory surgical results that two other specialists recommended have corrective action.  ,-1

585,34459,1.0,Very sad to see the negative comments about Dr. Schindler. He was kind of rude or short once with us but he needed to get his point across and it worked. I'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate incidents with the other families but Dr. Schindler definitely did an excellent job when he operated on our daughter. No complications what so ever and we owe him big time. ,1

His calm demeanor and taking the time to talk and joke with our child made all the difference in what was once an ordeal. He’s been our family dentist for numerous years now.   We find that Dr. Studer isn’t assertive on extensive dental work; he will try to save a tooth /teeth before he recommends any extensive dental work.   He doesn’t have a high turnover of staff, all of which are helpful and courteous and his billing practice is more than fair.  ",1

The optical staff was under trained and did not listen to what I was looking for. When I returned for my glasses 2 weeks later they had the wrong lenses which I was unable to see through. They told me I'd get used to it. I refused the lenses and asked to see the doctor. They would not allow me to see him. I was made to feel that I was the problem.I was paying almost $1000 dollars for top of the line Essilor lenses and Silouhette frames. The lenses were supposed to be very thin and were close to 1/2 inch thick. I came back after they were remade only to find the lenses still thick and blurry. DR. Sayler saw me but was rude and demeaning. I contacted the lense company to inquire as to why my lenses were thick and they gave me information to share with the doctor. When I did he became irate and told me he was the best eye doctor in Sioux Falls and I knew nothing. Sad scenario. ,-1

He listens to concerns and addresses each item. With my 2nd c-section I nearly had to have an emergency hysterectomy, although I had no idea because he continued on with the surgery very professionally. One day later he came into my room, sat down, and told me all about what had happened. He said he didn't want to worry me because he felt very confident in what he needed to do to avoid the hysterectomy, and he wanted me to just enjoy my new baby for a while.  I could go on &amp; on about him! I have recommended him to everyone I know!

He told me it was because I needed to have a bowel movement. He told me to eat fiber and sent me home. This did not work, and I was still throwing up. So I went back. He told me to take this stuff that makes you go to the bathroom all day until there is nothing left in you (magnesium citrate). I did this and by the end of the day, after I hadn't eaten hardly anything and had been in the bathroom all day, I was still throwing up. I went back. When I was there, he acted like I was a pain in the neck, and sighed like, &quot;Oh, it's you again.&quot; The next thing he said was,&quot;Well, there's always AIDS.&quot; No, there's not always AIDS. I have had one sexual partner in my life, my fiance, who is perfectly healthy. Needless to say, I found a new doctor. Turns out my throwing up was due to acid reflux.  ",-1
647,34489,1.0,"I would not recommend this doctor to anyone unless they begin seeing him when they are perfectly healthy and establish their good medical standpoint with him before anything happens. Dr. Schulz really lead me wrong. I had to begin seeing him while I was having medical problems, because my prior physician retired from the family practice field. I was always treated as a hypochondriac and as though I had no idea what I was talking about. Even though I would go in with complaints of strong daily allergic reactions, he would do nothing except note that I was overweight and needed to exercise and that I was depressed. I have injuries that prevent me from doing many exercises (other Dr's had told me not to do them). He said to do them even though they caused me extreme pain. After being talked down to and ignored for long enough (and seeing his terribly undetailed and unrelated-to-visit notes in my file), I left and found a great new physician elsewhere, outside the Sanford system.

His staff could have offered me another appointment since he was running so late. When I did get to see him, he stated that he was tied up w/ some other emergency (this is understandable, but I could have been given another appointment); then he acted as if my complaints were minute and not worthy of his attention.  He commented that the prior patient couldn't even move his kneck - thus my knee problem I guess doesn't matter. ",-1

He refused me surgery saying I did not need it and I should just go back to work. I got the surgery from another Dr and it fixed a problem with my back so I can now get out of a chair, unassisted which I could not do before I had the surgery. Dr. Suga went so far as to tell me that 95% of people have my condition. I doubt this as 95% of the people can get out of a chair without help and I couldn't. He also made a statement that I was not in as much pain as I claimed I was, as if he could feel my pain. If he could he would have been more compassionate. Compasion was not something I expierienced at the hands of Dr. Suga. It has been 12 years post op now and I am still doing well with the surgery from another dr. Be sure you get a doctor that is for you, the patient, not workmans comp. If you have a choice, pass on Suga or fight for the right Dr. for you! ",-1

He came to the hospital to admit my husband on a Sunday when he was not on call, because the neurologist wouldn't.

Dr. Sears didn't even do a strep test/blood test/any test at all. And the kicker-- I was visiting family over Christmas break.

After injecting the knee, (though he still wasn't sure what was wrong) I waited a few weeks and then called as it wasn't much better.

I left in tears with no solution. Just a life that I now will have with major scaring on my face that was avoidable if I hadn't had the procedure done by Dr. Schutz. Please believe me.

He is a family physician and deals with many urgent and &quot;work-in&quot; patients on daily basis (like all other doctors for that matter). Seriously, if your waiting time is your biggest concern then go to a walk-in clinic or acute-care center. Medicine isn't fast food and dealing with patient's issues takes time. I'm sure if these people that complain  about the wait were diagnosed with a serious problem,they would expect to spend some extra time with the doctor talking about it or would they want to make sure the doctor is kept on schedule.

Missed a very critical diagnosis in my 2nd pregnancy; because he has been around for a while, thinks every concern is normal. Not willing to research in depth certain things because of this approach. Not good experiences with bedside manner, sometimes rude and quick to judge - not a good listener. Is a mostly good Dr and I know he is very knowledgable, just wish he would go back to the basics.

With the chiropractic and physical therapy he offers, this is what made the difference in my health!  He fits me in whenever I need to get into see him.  I never have to wait.  Also the staff is extremly helpful and happy. ",1
724,34519,1.0,Increased business comes first at this office.  I'm uncomfortable if they set you up with a package &quot;deal&quot; before the Dr. even sees you. ,-1
725,34519,1.0,I LOVE HIS OFFICE!! Everyone knows you! Very friendly.. Made my back and neck feel AWESOME!! ,1

728,34519,1.0,"Very pleased with treatment, haven't felt better in years! ",1
729,34520,1.0,The office manager is very to the point and often almost unfriendly. Dr. Unruh is a capable physician during the manual treatments. He tells jokes that may offend some people. The waiting room seats are too low and too soft for people with back problems. The doctor seems to be actively pushing a Republican agenda. ,1
730,34520,1.0,Very professional and wonderful care. Dr. Unruh has been extremely helpful on several occasions to my family. He is a Christian man that is very honest as well as extremely knowlegeable. Dr. Unruh has saved many from surgeries and I being a nurse have total faith in him.  He does not keep you coming back un-necessarily. I would highly recommend Dr. Unruh.  ,1
731,34520,1.0,Dr Unruh & staff have been very pleasant to work with.  I was referred by several co-workers at BCBS & we have all had great success with our conditions.  I would highly recommend him. ,1
732,34520,1.0,Has no compassion.  More concerned about pushing his political agenda than helping women to live a better life.  Has a hard time believing that everyone doesn't believe in his way of thinking and will continue to make your life miserable until you see the light the way he sees it.  Very narrow minded.  Likes to control others lives.  Doesn't believe in majority rule. ,-1
733,34520,1.0,"He literally caused several of my spinal discs to rupture.  After destroying my spine, I ended up having to have an abortion due to inability to work to pay for the new baby!!  What a nightmare. ",-1
734,34520,1.0,"His office seemed more concerned with getting paid than with helping the patient. Felt like I was not very important, only the money was. ",-1
735,34522,1.0," He is a very great doctor and also great with kids, including special needs.  ",1
736,34539,1.0, Dr. Watson and his staff were awesome.  We tried different non surgical things before I had go have surgery.  I would recommend him and his PA to anyone. ,1
737,34539,1.0," A very capable surgeon.  Offered several options relative to my needed surgery.  He had to do a more extensive job once the surgery began, but that had been one of the things he had explained during my initial consultation.  His P.A. is great and also very professional.  I have referred other family members to him because of my confidence in his ability.  Answers any and all questions during appointments and his P.A. returned my calls as well.  Very happy with Dr. Watson and staff! ",1
738,34539,1.0," VERY friendly guy! However, at each appointment I've had to wait up to an hour and a half before getting called back to be seen by the doctor. Physician assistant is the nicest lady you'll ever meet! Overall, a great doctor experience. ",1
739,34539,1.0," Dr. Watson is WONDERFUL!!!  One of the truly best Dr's out there.  He was very compassionate when I came to see him for my foot injury.  He was very precice on everything he did, and took the time to explain my injury in detail & in Leimans terms so that it was easier to understand the injury and also with different possibilities of treatment routes. He is one of the few Dr's out there that seem to really care about his patients wellbeing.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Watson.  I would recommend anyone to see him if you have a foot or ankle problem.  Keep up the GREAT work Dr.  Watson!!! ",1

741,34540,0.0," Dr. Westbrook painstakingly helped me through a very traumatic back injury, and provided me her medical pain management treatment. I have recovered after several surgeries and now living a pain free and normal life I have resumed life and am happy with the services she and her staff provided me.  ",1
742,34540,0.0," In Dr. Westbrooks care, from people I know as well as me, if you are not a drug addict before you go in, you will be one before you leave . I went in for a concern of taking to much of a weak pain med.Within a year I was loaded up on oxycontin. She is basicly a legalized drug dealer and she knows how to keep people coming to see her. And if you do not pay up completly before your next &quot;visit&quot; she will not see you. And if you are taking oxy you will do anything, I mean ANYTHING, to get the money for more. The money is to be sent to her personel account in New York. I detoxed off all the pain meds and have little to no pain anymore. Go to floridadetox.com  if you want out of that awful addiction.  ",-1
743,34540,0.0," I felt very uncomfortable asking questions or voicing concerns about procedures and medications she was prescribing - she seemed offended as if I was questioning her expertise.  When I had to page her due to an emergency, she began the conversation with &quot;I hope you know i'm supposed to be on vacation!&quot;.  There needs to be more concerned with the patient's wellbeing.  ",-1
744,34540,0.0," Dr. Westbrook is the only doctor who has been able to offer me any type of relief, but still hasn't been able to 'cure' me. I like that she is open to many types of procedures that other doctors in the area will not even address. My only complaint is that I think there is a lack of communication between the doctor and patient, but otherwise the visits have been fairly average in satisfaction. ",1
745,34540,0.0," Dr. Westbrook has been treating a chronic condition I have for years. I consistently wait an hour in her waiting room, a half an hour before the nurse will see me, and another hour before the doctor herself shows up. A gentle bedside manner is nonexistant, and you are a chart as opposed to a patient. There is no eye contact, and any questions you ask are treated as an attack on her knowledge of medicine. She's very impersonable and cold. ",-1
746,34542,1.0," Visited this doctor as a new patient for a yearly checkup. After his nurse took BP and heart rate his contribution was basically an ear, nose and respiratory exam and an order for general blood work. Hardly what i am used to for a yearly exam especially that I just turned 50. Had mentioned the prescription drugs and dosages I was currently taking and noted on his visit review document that he had noted all the dosages incorrectly. I should, &quot;continue taking 100 mgs of Imitrex 4 times a day&quot;&#63; If that were the case I'd have much bigger problems! His general knowledge of prescription drugs left me feeling that he has not kept current for some time. While many drugs can fall into the same category, the way each works can differ but the doctor's reply to my request to switch a given medication was to the effect of, &quot;they're all the same&quot;.   I can not recommend Dr. Weiland due to his apparent lack of medical knowledge and the inaccuracy of documentation. Surely the latter outweigh the former. ",-1
747,34542,1.0," The amount of time spent during the physical exam averages 5 min or less.  Not thorough in the least.   Prostate exam &quot;in and out&quot;...that's it.  Professional but very defensive if asked questions.  May be a very good generalist however with multiple medical conditions, may not be a good choice for a physician.  ",-1
748,34542,1.0," This pleasant and friendly doctor spent adequate time discussing my medical history, but the physical exam was extremely cursory. He didn't listen to carotids, iliac arteries, palpate lymph nodes or abdomen, such as to check for pulsatile masses, ie. a check for developing aneurisms, or check for peripheral pulse strength. The least thorough exam I've ever received. He didn't do a prostate exam which might be all right given some of the evidence that precludes such exams in low risk moderately older men, but there are always exceptions to studies that find such results. I do not enjoy the exam, but need to do more checking to see if it still should be done even in light of a history of low PSA results. Dr. Weiland and his nurse have been very helpful with fast response to prescriptions and queries about various subjects. I believe I'll still try this gentleman in the future, but hope for more in depth examinations, especially as I get older.  ",1
749,34545,1.0, Said I needed surgery for an anel fissure....went to the Mayo Clinic and they said that there was absolutly no need for surgery.  Mayo fixed my problem on the spot. Stay away from conventional doctors is my best advice.  ,-1
750,34545,1.0, The best. Took his time and really cared about you as a person. He wouldn;t open me up because it could cause more harm than good. He is also going to be checking with other doctors about my care and how I am doing. SUPERB ,1
751,34545,1.0," Based upon the recommendation of my gastroentrologist, I set up an appointment with Dr. Wheeler to have a Nissan fundoplication. I had no problem with the requirement to set up a separate appt just to discuss the procedure. He required invasive, painful pre-surgery tests to determine if I was a good candidate for the surgery, but then advised surgery before even looking at the results. He did not do so until I specifically asked him to. I came to the pre-surgery information appt having researched the surgery and with a list of questions.  He perfunctorily told me that he didn't have time to talk to me about the surgery (even though that was the entire purpose of the appt), so if I had questions, I needed to make ANOTHER appt.  He was the quintessential negative stereotype of the arrogant surgeon.  End of story&#63; I had the surgery - it was a failure, and I am worse off now than if I had never had the surgery. I am now scheduled to go to Mayo Clinic to see if they can fix his mess.  ",-1
752,34546,1.0, Dr Weekly is very knowledgeable and patient to questions. I have been very pleased with his service. I was in a terrible accident and he was one of the specialist that was called and did an awesome job.  ,1

754,34555,0.0, I have been going to Wallace for 9 years and would not trade her for anything. She is the best dr ever and is very smart and she truly does care about her patients no matter the age.

755,34555,0.0, I went with my elderly mother to this Doctor.  She was not very friendly or concerned and has very little personal interest.  She does the very minimum and is ready to refer the patient to someone else. Most people go out of their way for older people.  ,-1

757,34555,0.0, I have been going to Dr Caryn Wallace for several years now.  She has been my favorite Dr. so far.  She always takes the time to sit and listen to you.  I never feel rushed when I see her.  She always looks at all possible causes and will order tests to rule things out. ,1

767,34557,1.0," Dr watt did a fourth surgery after Dr rice messed up my back from three surgeries. He was a concerned Doc ,but no relief after completing the fourth surgery supposidly to fix Dr rice&quot;s bad work.I now am in chronic pain 24/7 and would not let any Doc from the Spine Center touch me ever again,even though they want to do a fifth surgery to remove the instumatation in my spine.I will be going to either oklahoma or to Mayo for further testing and /or another surgery.I hurt like hell and its for a lifetime of misery to let these guys cut away. ",-1
768,34557,1.0, I saw Dr. Watt for back surgery. I ended up in more pain than before and had to see one of the other doctors in the office to fix an infection. A nurse told me that Dr. Watt seems to have a lot of patients with infections. He is also a little spacey. No I don't recommend him at all.  ,-1
769,34561,1.0, My daughter had to have emergency surgery on her finger after she had a landscape block fall on it and an infection set in. We were worried that she would lose her finger if the infection got to the bone. I let the dr's staff know our daughter even though she's only 7 does better if she knows what's going on. Dr walker came in and explained to her what they were going to do and what might happen depending on what he found. He was very professional and did a great job informing my daughter and me as well. As for this surgical skills they are great her finger looks like a finger again. The dr also worked hard so we can save her nail which is very important to a 7yr old girl.  I would recommend Dr Walker to anyone with kids ,1
770,34561,1.0, I am a youger female who had no cartilage left in my knee.  If not for Dr. Walker I would still be walking with crutches.

771,34561,1.0," Had my child to him ONCE. Asked for a referral to another Dr.  He was not helpful in answering questions and actually said &quot;let me be the doctor&quot;.  Would not answer our questions.  Arrogent.  Had us purchase an expensive bracing device ($2,300) that the next Dr. said was totally inappropriate to have purchased (1 month later).  Hopefully he is more courteous to others and has lightened up on his bedside manner.. ",-1
772,34561,1.0," Excellent doctor.  Very knowledgeable and great bedside manner.  I had had an MRI on Tuesday and surgery on Friday.  He expalined everything from what he was doing to follow up exercises, very thorough and knowledable.  I would highly recommend him to anyone.  ",1

I called to schedule an appointment for a shoulder injury and was questioned on whether this was a new injury or not. I told them that I might have had this before but I wasn't sure. They told me they needed to see my records of the previous injury. After a long, long conversation during which I tried to explain that I did not have records as I was only looked at by a sport trainer who advised me to do some physical therapy, they still would not see me without previous records. The receptionist would not even explain to me why they needed records and did not seem to understand that none existed. When I asked what I should do to get help she responded with &quot;The doctor has the right to refuse service to anyone&quot; and then hung up on me. I was so upset and couldn't not believe that a doctor, who (I would hope) does his job to help people, refused to help someone for no (or at least unexplained) reason. ",-1

Very uncaring and not as concern about my problems and visit was not as comfortable as before Paid/Co-pay:$18400,-1
823,34661,1.0," I went to another Dentist for 3 months and he wouldn't touch my teeth until I had paid an unreal amt. I went to Dr. Baird, and he completely took care of my teeth, and was so nice!!!!! ",1
824,34663,1.0, I had hair restoration at BaconMD and am so happy. My thinning hair has bothered me for years but I didn't want to do the strip method and have the large scar. Dr. Bacon and his team created a beautiful hairline for me. They were so kind and spent a great deal of time with me discussing my options and my goals. Letting them do my hair restoration was the best decision I've made. Paid/Co-pay:$2000,1

826,34682,0.0," I was her &quot;patient&quot; over 2 years but never met her. I was always under the care of her NP. I asked the staff that I would like to see my physician, but she did not seem to care to have a 1:1 relationship with her patients. Her priority seems to participate in conventions/meetings and other &quot;important&quot; things than taking care of her patients. After having given her 2 years that she could have gained her opoortunity to hear my requests to meet her to no avail, I switched to someone else. I am much happier with my current physician. Staff of her office are wonderful, however.  ",-1
827,34682,0.0," I was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor while under the care of her office, and she never came to see me while I was in the hospital, or called to check on me after my brain surgery. Not a very caring doctor. ",-1

830,34682,0.0," I agree with several of the other comments. This doctor has no clue at all, unless you want a cosmetic consultation. I went in for a UTI, but she said I did not have a UTI even though my urinalysis showed bacteria and the culture confirmed it. She said there was &quot;not enough bacteria to cause a UTI&quot;. HUH&#63; Are you kidding me&#63; That was not the first time something like that happened. As soon as possible after insurance changes- I changed doctors. Would NOT recommend this doctor to anyone.

832,34683,1.0," I love Dr. Baig! He has been a God send to me. When I was real bad with gout pain, he referred me to another doctor that helped me get better. I recommend him to my family and friends, even got my daughter going there to see him. He does his best to help out, and he has a wonderful bedside manner.  ",1
833,34684,1.0," His office billed insurance nearly $800 for a visit with lab work! ran every test he could think of, then prescribed mininimal amount of medication. every complaint I raised about medicine he seemed to make up a policy on the spot to justify his answers. Doesn't listen to patients, just refills meds a month at a time to maximize his businesses profits. Both my wife and I went to seee this quack based on reviews on the internet.  After 3 months, his practice has billed our insurance company over $10, 000 and neither our problems have been addressed!!! If you want to get healthy or find a solution to your problem, DO NOT SEE THIS DOCTOR!!! ",-1

835,34684,1.0, Morning visit --told me the patients lungs sounded &quot;pretty good&quot;  Mentioned  patient had conditions that a specialist had said were cleared up days before. Told him this &amp; he didn't answer.   That same morning another  specialist we had never met appeared &amp; told us the patient was in acute respiratory distress. Never felt he kept us informed adequately.   Nurses report he is difficult to understand on phone esp. &amp; gets angry when they have to ask him to repeat. ,-1
836,34684,1.0," He understands his patients perfectly, and ensure that they don't freak out about their wellness especially when they are seriously ill. I have known him for many years and he has been a very caring and wonderful doctor. ",1
837,34684,1.0, When you finally get in to see him and he orders all these test first he forgets to read them then he says there is nothing wrong but to come the next month to run them again and he forgets to send your medicine for the bronchitus you have and it takes a week or more to try and get in touch with them or get them to call back with results about the rest of the test taken. The next month the same stuff happened again except he forgot to write down to take the blood work that I came in for as he rushes out the door for lunch and it has been over a week now and I still have not been able to get my results or any antibiotics for my bronchitus maybe pneumonia that he took chest X-rays for but I can't get any results. ,-1
838,34695,2.0, Drs. Roger and Lorraine Bailey are hands down the best Chiropractors in the state of Tennessee.

844,34708,1.0," I'm a young, single female and I didn't choose to return to Alan Bachrach because he was overly friendly, flirtatious and mildly inappropriate (touching my hand and shoulder when not necessary, lingering too long. I ran into him at the store and unfortunately he remembered me. He was outright crude. ",-1
845,34708,1.0," I saw him in 2004 for a workman comp injury the entire time he did the EMG on my arm he talked about his inlaws,wife,and his children.I came for treatment not to hear that. After I was injury my left shoulder sits higher than my right he said he just could not see it but everyone else in this world including the judge can. I would never go back to him and take my advice and never use him for a workman comp he will side with them.I now have to take 10 pills a day for nerve damage and for the pain. ",-1
846,34708,1.0, Dr. Bachrach does indeed tell the spouse/parent to &quot;be quiet&quot; because he wants to get the patient to speak for him/herself which will truthfully reveal what's actually going on.  I was told the same thing when I took my daughter to see him.  I was not offended because I understood that he was wanting to get truth.  I was asked to talk later after he finished questioning her.  He has been unbelieveably compassionate and understanding with our situation (epilepsy).  I have even called him at home late at night and he was very kind.  My daughter has since married and moved out of state but will continue to see Dr. Bachrach.  He has had her seizures under control from day one.  We think the world of him and his staff. ,1
847,34708,1.0, he was very rude to me and my spouse. he actually told my spouse to not speak at all until she was told to even though she knew the answers to the questions that i did not. he told me i didnt have anything wrong with me without a real examination. told me most of my illnesses were in my head and that i shouldnt complain so much. he even told some one else that he was seeing to ignore her ADD and it will go away. in fact he told me that if i chant &quot;im healthy&quot; all the time i would be. he even insulted my marriage saying my spouse was too motherly just because she remembered medical history i didnt and she offered it! definitely unprofessional and rude. will never see him again.  ,-1
848,34709,0.0, The office has a modern and comfortable feel.  Dr. Baer is very careful to minimize any possible discomfort which is nice compared to other medical experiences I've had.  She makes going to the dentist a pleasant experience.  Who knew that was possible! ,1

852,34727,0.0," My husband ended up in ICU for several days after a procedure done by this medical provider.  The staff at the outpatient surgery center would not allow me to go back and see my husband in the recovery area, and he was there from 11 am until after 5 pm.  The nurse said she was afraid to let me go back there because she feared I would &quot;be upset&quot; when I saw him.  Indeed I was.  He was talking gibberish, as if he'd had a stroke.  Just prior to my seeing my husband, I had talked with Dr. Dang by phone and he told me it would be better for me to take my husband home, and that this was not an emergency requiring hospitalization.  My husband almost died and spent days in ICU on dialysis.  We are lucky he survived.  ",-1
853,34727,0.0," During my procedure, I complained of pain and it took several minutes for him to respond.  Nurses were wandering in and out of the room while I was facing the door half undressed, during the procedure.  Later I found out that the procedure he used was actually outdated and is currently know to make the problem permanently worse.  When he was trying to address the pain the procedure caused, while I was crying, he talked to me about it in the hallway, in front of nurses and other patients, instead of in an exam room.  Lastly, I paid almost a grand to see him with the end result being that my problem was worse, not improved.  ",-1

857,34749,1.0, Cut or torn bile duct during surgery. Dr. Daley never admitting to doing anything wrong. I never even got an apology. Required another major surgery for repair. Now I have permanent liver damage and recurrent infections. His actions negatively changed my life forever. ,-1

859,34749,1.0," Dr Daley did surgery on me in June of 08. Laproscopic surgery,sent me home same day,Friday. Monday following I was rushed back to hospital with a leaking bile duct.I almost died, it took me well over six weeks to recover somewhat from this surgery.He told me as thin as I was there was virtually zero chance of bile duct being knicked. He ****ed me and I am no better today than I was before the procedure if anything I am worse. I had insurance that paid only 80% of the medical bills I had to have another surgery at my expense to remove the stint that had to be placed by my GI dr which I also had to pay for this surgery, hospital stay and medications and then the removal of stint, hospital stay and medications.  I would not take my dog to this man. I would rather have had my dog's surgeon than have him again.I do not know the total amt of bill as I am still paying and probably will be for the rest of my life. ",-1
860,34750,0.0," This lady is very unknowledgeable! Both my kids have seen her when they were sick and couldn't see their doctor who is in the same office. Both times she told me &quot; oh its just a little cold&quot;, even after we told her how long it had been going on, even after we told her he keeps pulling at his ear. Took him to see his Dr two days later and he had bronchitis so bad he had to take breathing treatments and also had a severe ear infection. My sister-in-law took her son to see her when he was a baby and very sick. She said same thing, just a cold, he was put in the hospital a few days later with bacterial meningitis, he was in the hospital for weeks, and he could have died. Go see Dr. Erinle.

862,34754,1.0," My father has seen Dr. Daniel for 25 years.  I truly feel if it had not been for Dr. Daniel my father may not have survived this many years.  He is an excellent doctor and has always given my father excellent care.  His staff has always listened to my concerns if I had to call about my father and and was VERY prompt in returning my call or transfered me immediatly. Me and my family believe that Dr. C.B. Daniel is the BEST and we thank God everyday foe giving him the knowledge to help my father.  Thank you, Dr. Daniel for all you have done for our family.  ",1
863,34754,1.0," I love Dr Daniel. He is very attentive and does not rush you once you are in room;however it does take a while to be put in a room and once there another good wait, but more and more doctors don't take medicare and he does.  ",1
864,34754,1.0, I was told to arrive at a certain time as a new pt. His receptionist stayued on the phone with a ersonal conversation gnoring me for 13-minuts.  I then had to wait an addtional hour until I asked about my appointment.  I was told my chart was just put on a ledge back there and forgotten. The doctor was fairly knowledgeable and helpful but I felt very rushed. ,1
865,34754,1.0," Long wait in waiting room, but once you see him you receive competent care. ",1
866,34754,1.0," I have had trouble finding a doctor who is thorough and takes his job seriously, so I was glad to find Dr. Daniel.  I am middle-aged, and Dr. Daniel keeps good tabs on my numbers and lets me know if anything is out of line.  Also, I have never had to wait more than a few minutes in the waiting room.  I have found his staff to be quick and polite.  ",1
867,34764,1.0," This doctor is the best dentist I've ever been in contact with. He is compassionate,knowlegeable,friendly,answers questions with answers the layman can understand. His staff is friendly and knowledgeable. If u have surgery he or his team will be calling u to check to see if all is ok or u have questions. The best of the best :) ",1

873,34798,0.0," I saw this doctor after I had seen her partner who was a np for a few years. When my np left to work at an ER I thought I would try her. She was not friendly at all and did not really listen to what I was saying about my thyroid and ankle. My ankle is fused, and I have chronic severe pain from a car accident several years ago. I have never taken anything for it except for the last two years (Tramadol), it is the only thing that works. She said I needed to see a Orthopedic which I told her I had alredy seen and she wanted to make me another appointment with a different one, even after I told her they all want to give me are antinflammatory and I told her that they do not even touch the pain, and I have back and hip problems due to the fact that I lost 1 1/2 inches on my right foot. She wanted to start all over with my thyroid when I was just recently out and wanted to do blood work all over again. She has no bedside manner at all and did not seem to care about my problems. NP was great.  ",-1
874,34807,0.0," I love Dr. Daniel.  There is a long wait at her office, but it is worth it.  She is very knowledgable and compassionate toward her patients.   She takes time to listen to all your concerns and is a wonderful doctor! ",1
875,34810,1.0, Dr Dang is a good doctor.  But his staff are rudest.  Always the waiting time is more than 1 and half hour.  the support staff treat like a begger. That is the only thing I hate about it over there. Not sure if i would go back to that doctor again.  ,1
876,34810,1.0," The reception staff at Dr. Dang's is the rudest I've ever experienced. You are treated as if you are in line for food stamps. And plan to wait an hour to an hour and a half.Dr. Dang is approachable with a good bed side manner. However, it seems he runs from room to room. I'm home now with a sinus infection. I just called his office, and yes, they maintained their rude attitude. I was hoping to have him call me in an antibiotic, but that is against their policy...just an fyi - for a prescription re-fill you have to see Dr. Dang, put up with his rude staff and wait an hour plus. ",1
877,34810,1.0," I agree with the above-Dr. Dang is great, very helpful and will listen to you; however, his staff leaves a lot to be desired.  I seem to be the one that slips through every crack, everytime.  They forgot me in an exam room once-my appt was at 3 and I wasn't &quot;discovered&quot; until 4:30 when they were closing for the day. They also change your appt time without asking and also schedule appts without asking what works.  Wait time is awful.  I need to find a new doctor because I can't stand the staff.  Let me say again: Dr. Dang-very good, love him, hate to leave.  Staff-very bad, not going to miss them.  ",1
878,34810,1.0, Dr. Dang has been taking care of me for several years.  He listens to me; does my physicals without a lot of extra tests etc.   I like him very much! ,1
879,34810,1.0," Dr. Dang seems to be a good dr. with a very busy practice.  He always seems to be very frazzled when he makes it in to see me and tends to forget important information when he leaves the room (I have seen him during three pregnancies and nursing three babies and he will start to prescribe me something I can't take until I remind him).  His office staff is AWFUL.  There is never less than a 45 minute wait to see him and once you get in a room, expect an additional 30 minute wait.  I have counted up to 8 drug reps in the waiting room who seem to share the appointments available with the sick patients.  ",1
880,34810,1.0," Dr. Dang is a very kind and caring doctor. I am not truly impressed with his staff. If he isn't in the office on a day you call, then the help stops there. They give you the impression they will get back to you but the returned call is never received. This has happened to me twice.n Again, let me state, Dr. Paul Dang is an outstanding doctor and would recommend him personally.  ",1
881,34817,1.0, The best doctor in the world. You will love him. I have never seen him not smiling and cutting up. ,1

884,34843,0.0," This woman was rude and condescending to me. She looked at my wound with obvious, open distain. I've never felt such a sense of hubris bordering on malice towards my wife and myself, since I've been seeing any doctor. It was quite obvious she enjoyed her work as long as she could simply order some intern to do the real work, and that being near an actual suppurating wound filled her with disgust. She wore a mini skirt that came up to her rear and spike heels. I could hear her outside the exam room talking to staff about her thoroughbred horses and laughing, when she came in there wasn't even a fake smile on her face. I felt like less than a human being, I felt like she would have given more compassionate care to an animal. This woman should be a vet, if that. ",-1
885,34848,2.0," very nice office, great staff,does great work ",1
886,34853,1.0," Dr. Gallagher did my eyes, upper and lower.  I am very happy with the results and my eyes look great. There are no visible scars and the shape is very nice. ",1

888,34853,1.0, Watch out for his lasers at his spa.  I have been left with bad marks. ,-1
889,34853,1.0," Dr. Gallaher is a nice man, but he absolutely ruined my eyes.  I had an upper bleph done 18 months ago.  One eye had more skin than the other and looks even worse after surgery.  Too much skin was taken off inside corners and not enough taken off outside corners.  I am also left with obvious scars on the outer corners.  Dr. Gallaher might be good at other procedures, but please go elsewhere for eyes.  I will have to live with the mistake of choosing him the rest of my life.  I am very disappointed with my outcome. ",-1
890,34853,1.0, Dr. Tom Gallaher is an incredible surgeon with an eye for detail and a heart full of compassion. I highly recommend him for any plastic or reconstructive procedure. ,1
891,34857,1.0," He's been treating folks like me for over 40 years. For the first time I'm being heard about my mental health status. He's a well seasoned veteran with a sharp mind, a comforting manner and a sense of humor.  He sees right through the BS and denial most of we alcoholics thrive on. ",1
892,34862,1.0, Very cheap but made up for it with very painful treatment!  He did not numb the area well at all and was very unpersonable!  He pulled 3 teeth and did not even stitch up the gum!  I now have very deep &quot;trench&quot; in area and malformed gum!  My worst experience ever!!! ,-1
893,34863,1.0, Dr Gallant is a very nice man he if he cant figure out whats goin on with you then he will send you to someone that will. I like dr Gallant hes been my primary doctor for a long time and he is very knowledgable. ,1
894,34863,1.0, He is very nice. I went in for a routine check up and he discovered i had cancer. Luckilly it was in the early stages so he save my life.  ,1
895,34863,1.0, TRYING TO GET THEM TO DO SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS CALLING IN A PRESCRIPTION OR HAVING THE DOCTOR LOOK OVER MY CHART WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH. NOT ONLY THAT THE DOCTOR IS RUDE. I DON'T BELIEVE DOCTOR OR STAFF HAVE A GOOD WORK ETHIC NOR ARE THEY VERY PROFESSIONAL. ,-1

900,34878,1.0, Had a brain tumor biopsy done and he was extremely nice and talked to us about everything.  He has a great sense of humor and is friendly.  I wish I could use him as a doctor for everything.  ,1
901,34880,1.0, What a waste of time and money! Rude and inconsiderate of your time. Be prepared to wait forever and then be talked to with a smart aleck attitude. Misdiagnosis and then doctor and staff got hateful with me for bringing it up at next visit. Stay away from this guy. Does not show any interest in your concerns and ignores your questions. ,-1
902,34880,1.0," Very rude!!  Was not on time!! Interupted me while I was explaining my complaint, He said, &quot;shut up and listen here&quot;. I have never been treated like this by no one nor will I ever be again.  I would not recommend Dr Gallagher to any one in Knoxville area.  ",-1

906,34892,1.0, Dr. Gafford has been taking care of me for 10 years. His skills are impressive. He was able to diagnose a complicated problem and help me obtain care before a serious problem developed. He also spends plenty of time listening to concerns and stays up to date on the latest developments.  ,1
907,34892,1.0," This docotor is AWFUL! He does not truely care about his patients and wants to get you out of his office as quickly as possible. When I called him to inform him that once again my migrane medication that he put me on was not working (and I get severe migranes every week) and I asked him to give me something for the pain, he refused and said if I am in pain then all he can do is suggest I go to the emergency room. So I have been forced to go the the ER 4 times this month alone and I cannot afford this! When I first saw him about my condition he gave me not five minutes to describe my symptoms and then baiscally just left the room and had his nurse come back in with a script for meds. He did not care to discuss anything with me and did not seem as though he cared about helping me at all. He is the worst doctor I have ever seen and everyone else I have spoken to who has seen him has said the same.  ",-1
908,34893,0.0," this was one of the worst md's ive been with, unfriendly, unproffesional.. a disgrace ",-1
909,34893,0.0, So friendly and helpful. Makes you feel very comfortable. She has a very gentle nature and also seems very genuinely interested in the lives of her patients. She doesn't rush you in and out. I will use her as long as she practices in TN.  ,1
910,34894,1.0, Not a good experience! Doctor was rude and never fully explained anything! I understand being busy but if you can't handle so many patients then you should not take on so many...  Oh wait that's money for your pocket! What was I thinking! Always get a second opinion I knew in my gut something was wrong when dr Gahndi spent less than 10 min with us and would never return phone calls! I so wish I would have took my granny to someone else ,-1
911,34894,1.0," Dr. G told my aunt that my grandmother has only a few months left to live. My aunt, being in complete shock, didn't ask about hospice or any other end of life options. We have been trying for over a week to make an appointment with him, as a family, to discuss this. We were basically told by his RN and staff that he has ignored all pages and attempts to even make an appointment with us. I guess once he can't make any more money off of you he doesn't care.  ",-1
912,34894,1.0, Dr. Gandhi and his staff make you feel like you are the only patient and they make you feel they care. ,1
913,34894,1.0, My father was treated for lung cancer by Dr Gandhi in 2006-07.  Dr. Gandhi and his staff were wonderful to my Dad and my family.  We were all treated with care and compassion.  My father passed away in February 2007 but we are confident that he recieved the best care available.  ,1

920,34915,0.0,"My first visit, my mom & I sat for over 4 hours before I was even called back, then waited another half hour before seeing a nurse/practitioner. She immediately, without many questions raised my pain medication a huge leap. Skip forward several months, and I still didn't know what this doctor looked like because I never saw him. I cried the day that the nurse changed my meds again, for about the forth time, to morphine. I was in pain, but felt this was extreme, especially since I had never even met the doctor yet. Months went by and many medications before I finally met the doctor and he was so rude and unkind, I left crying and went back to my regular doctor for help, who was shocked at all the meds this office had put me on for months on end without ever even talking to dr. le. BTW, every visit was a full day because I always had to wait a very long time to get in.  ",-1

924,34917,1.0,"By far one of the best doctors I've been to and THE BEST Pediatrician I've ever had for my kids. He listens to you, answers any questions you have and truly cares for his patients. I have since moved away and I can't find a doctor who is 1/8 of what this Dr. was to my children. He gives his cell phone number in case you have any problems and I've never had any trouble getting in touch with him through the front desk. The wait is a little long at times but when you get in you see it's because he actually spends time with you when most doctors just get you in and out and barely look at you. I'm so upset that we aren't able to see him anymore because he is such a warm, caring, family-man that you rarely get to see in a doctor now.  ",1
925,34917,1.0,"Dr. Langenberg is one of the best doctors I have ever been to.  His personality is great and I really felt like he listened to my needs.  I don't really expect him to work for me for free and I don't expect his personal cell number in today's world unless I plan on paying him also for that call.  It is sometimes tough to get through all the front desk stuff to get to him, but once you do things are great.  I have been to a few doctors who have an excellent front desk, but then are not too good once you get in the room to see the doctor.  Langenberg seems to care about you and that is hard to find these days for sure.  ",1
926,34917,1.0,Dr.Mark is awesome. He listens and if he tries to figure out the problem and he can't.He is honest enough to send you to someone else and if you don't like that doctor. He will make a call to another just to get you seen quicker. He gave me his cell and I have had to use and he always got back with me ASAP. SO he is a nice guy he doesn't treat you like cattle running you in and out and come back in a week if that don't work. Because he listens he can usually determine your problems and prescribe what you need so u don't have to come back.  He is an A +++ man and doctor ,1
927,34917,1.0,"This is the worst dr's office I have ever been to. Nobody will answer the phone, and if by some chance they do, no one knows what is going on or can get an answer for you. You can't speak to the dr. unless you go into the office and pay him for his time. He won't answer phone calls or return emails. My children's last dr would give his patients his cell phone # to call anytime, day or night. This dr. doesn't care about his patients and is only after the money. It would really be nice when a parent has a question about their child's health if they would at least try to provide them with an answer instead of them having to wait for hours on end, worrying with no answers what so ever.

They have always addressed my concerns and if needed, worked my children in to be seen.  I have not had any bad experiences with the front office staff.  They are busy, but polite.

She basically hung up on me! Unbelievable and unacceptable! (Especially when I'd been a patient there before!) I would NEVER use them again and would NEVER send anyone I care about there. I just hope they refund the money they overcharged me... UGH! What a rotten experience! :-( My advice: go somewhere else if you have a choice. ,-1

960,34931,1.0,"I have plenty of respect for Dr. Larson as he will not prescribe any medications just because the pharmaceutical reps are constantly in the office building (he usually recommends established generics anyway). Obviously, there's a lot of trial-and-error in prescribing medications for psychiatry, but he keeps extremely up to date with the latest national research findings and has an encyclopedic memory of what has worked for his other patients so he can give you percentages of how successful certain medications have been for his other patients.

We had waited 2 hours and 45 mins. after being taken into the exam room for this type of treatment.  Bedside manner - None.  I am a veteran of many doctors and hospitals and work in the health care field. There is absolutely no justification for this type of treatment.  I seriously considered lodging a formal complaint with Vanderbilt.  Psychiatry&#63;   Please, he needs some counseling himself.  There are plenty of great neurology specialists out there, if referred to Dr. Lavin, request someone else.  Anyone with an illness will only feel worse after seeing him. ",-1

I had a severe migraine at the time and started crying. He told me I was depressed. No I am not and never or ever have been. I taught special ed for 21 years and know how to bring success to people who are in pain. He was horrible!! I heard other stories about him too and my regualar Dr was shocked to hear this.

Schedule an appointment with anyone else other than Dr Lazar. Finally, Dr Lazar's office staff told me went I asked on my initial visit, that they accept BC/BS. Dr Lazar is not in the BC/BS network.

When his office filed my insurance it cam back unpaid because Dr. Lazar is considered out of the loop.  I called his office and spoke to insurance person and office manager to see if they had verified the insurance before the surgery and I am not able to get a straight answer from his office.  So my questions is&#63;  Is Dr. Lazar still getting insurance payments for procedures that insruance companies do not cover because he could be considered out of the loop and his office staff are telling the patients that they are covered.  This is what he got in trouble for at LeBoheur Hospital doing taking the TN car pay offs for procedures he did not perform.  It is still stealing.  ,-1

He treated my husband like he was an idiot because he had anxiety and feelings he couldn't quite distinguish, but good grief, if he was getting his head cracked open he would be a little anxious too! After the surgery, we asked him to copy our neurologist on his notes, so they could both be on the same page. Evidently that was too much to ask because he said &quot;well I don't see why you can't tell her, its not like its brain surgery!&quot;  The man is an insensitive jackass.

This group also ignored all our worries about the amount of water my daughter was retaining. It took the emergency room staff to find out that she was having heart failure. She had Peripartum Cardiomyopathy and the doctor's group totally ignored the signs.

Resist sending patient to get Xrays, speciality treatment, or other medical procedures outside her office regardless of symtoms.  She has had one malpractice suit settlement against her in 2008 and possibly has had another malpractice suit filed in 2010.  2008 resulted in the death of her patient because she didn't take the time to see if the patient had received her dialysis the previous day before telling her patient to wait until the next day to go back to dialysis. She died that same day.She did not take the time to double check if proper treatment was received could have prevented untimely deaths.

My surgery time was delayed because of him being in surgery already, but that only improved my opinion of him because he did not hurry that patients surgery just because he knew I had been waiting for several hours. He was caring and concerned with any post operative problems I had. My follow-up appointments after surgery have been great, he lets me know where I am in my recovery process and where I need to go from here to continue to improve and get the best results possible from the surgery.

Dr. Lagrone is AWESOME! I have been seeing Dr. L for the past 13 years and he has helped me regain the ability to walk and use my arms. I have severe RA that was out of control. I am now on a regimen that allows me to live a NORMAL life. Remicade and Prednisone are wonderful drugs. They CAN be dangerous, but you take the good with the bad.

1073,34975,1.0,"I have been seeing Dr. Lagrone since 2000. Prior to that I had seen all kind of doctors who could not figure out what was wrong with me. I had gone from an active full-time employee, part-time college student, working out at the Y 3/4 days a week. Then I started to get fatigued, achy, no energy. Other  doctors ran all kinds of tests and there was no diagnosis. I saw Dr.Lagrone and for the first time I had hope. There was a name to what I had - fibromyalgia. It's not an easy illness to treat. Each patient is different. He has taken the time to keep me informed of new treatments and we have finally come up with a good mix of drugs that help me manage. Yes, it's true that he has a lot of meds in his arsenal and dispenses them accordingly but rheumatological diseases aren't cured. They're managed. And drugs are part of that along with physical therapy, lifestyle changes, etc which He also addresses. And he does all of this while showing a lot of compassion and dignity to this patient.  ",1
1074,34975,1.0,I completely disagree with the last statement posted.  Dr LaGrone and his NP are the most knowledgeable physician/np that I have come to know.

If your disease is not obivious, which can happen he will brush you off and give you the most popular drug. As a pre med student, its astounding how those that have the authority and knowledge can lead those astray. After gettin my medication from Dr. Lagrone, I had went into the e.r complaining about stomach pain. Come to find out my liver enzymes where elevated, when i spoke to Dr. Lagrone he took me off the only medicine he hadnt prescribe. 3 wks later his NP told me they had reviewed my file and saw nothing. It was only God, that gave me the feeling something wasnt right. So i checked all of the medicines he gave. Astoundingly, every medication he gave me attackes my liver. If that doesnt tell you anything nothing will. He is like so many physicians, out to get paid and rob the american pple instead of beig honest. He has no clue nor does his NP.  ",-1

At my first appointment, he was able to ,ale a diagnosis and begin treatment for something much more minor than the things I had been led to believe were causing my troubles.

Her appointmetn was at 1:30, at 2:45 she still had not been seen, she was told it would be a while longer, that the physician was out.  My daughter made the lady at the desk aware she had been waiting, picked up the injection and just wanted someone to give it to her.  She was told she had to see the physician, that others were before her.  She explained that she had a 2 year old being restless and hungry.  She asked for her records back.  She was told it would take an hour to do that.  Talk about poor customer service.  Would not recommend anyone to go there.  She is going to find another physicians office.   Don't go there! ",-1

1100,34984,1.0,"My wife and I went in for first new-mother OB checkup.  We were face-to-face with him for literally about four minutes in total.  He even answered a phone call while he was there!  He did a breast exam (this took him about 25-30 seconds), then he did the fastest pap-smear ever (it took him about 45 seconds).  He seemed to be in a rush and showed no desire to talk with my wife and me about anything.  He wasn't overtly rude, but it was clear that he was not interested in building any type of doctor-patient relationship with us.  Everything we've been told says that on a first OB checkup, especially for brand new mothers, the doctor will sit and talk with you about your history, any concerns you might have, give helpful advice about things to do or avoid, etc.  Basically, have a conversation.  We got no advice, and he asked &quot;any questions&#63;&quot; as he was literally in the process of walking towards the door.  We took our cue and walked towards the door ourselves, and we will not be returning.  ",-1

After consulting 3 other surgeons, I found out that I had to have corrective surgery immediately to fix the mess he made. The correction was not minor and involved metal plates, multiple screws, a bone graft and a tendon transfer. Because of Dr. Lamb, I am in pain every single day and I will more than likely have to have more corrective surgeries in the future. Do NOT use Dr. Lamb. Do NOT trust him.

She told me that I was morbidly obese and that she would not help me if I ended up pregnant. I had originally gone to see her because we were thinking about starting a family. I am overwieght (NOT MORBIDLY!) and had started weight watchers the month before which I have been very successful with. My primary care doctor has had a discussion with me about my weight and suggested that weight watchers be best for me.

I have been a patient for over a decade and would reconmend him to family or friends.  The office staff and nurse of professional and kind.  If you wait, it is because he take the time with each of his patient and as a patient I like that.  ",1
1267,35044,1.0,"I feel this doctor takes the time to sit down with me and listen fully to my situation.  This is unusual in my experience with doctors.  He has a sense of humor and the ability to put me at ease.  He also does not pretend he knows everything and has appropriately sent me to a specialist when needed.  He is thorough and follows procedures, which may seem irritating, according to another person who posted.  However, I have learned after years of seeing him that he has a high level of integrity and I trust him to be thorough and diligent.  ",1
1268,35045,1.0,"Very caring doctor.  He personally calls you with test results, and never seems to be in a hurry when you talk to him.

Excellent service, very knowledgeable, and one of the few docs left that actually listens to you and doesn't make you feel stupid if you question him or want to try an alternate treatment.

1274,35047,1.0,"Have been seeing Dr Naylor since 2007. He takes time to listen to me and my concerns, explains what is going on with drawings etc. Has been supportive even when I had problems with an other physician. Excellent surgeon I am disabled with degenerative bone disease Dr Naylor is a great general orthopedic surgeon and has no problems referring me to a specialist when such is needed and is in my best interest.  ",1
1275,35047,1.0,"I strongly recommend that if Dr. Naylor tells you you need surgery, get a second opinion.  He may be a good surgeon, but he told me surgery was my only option and it simply wasn't true.  The second doctor I went to informed me that many people live healthy lives with the same injury I have.  He gave me a cortisone shot and sent me to physical therapy and I am back to almost 100% in just one month.  Dr. Naylor comes off as very slick.  I felt like I was dealing with a salesperson at Best Buy rather than a physician.  He talks very quickly, telling various stories that had nothing to do with my medical issues and left little time for questions or discussion.  Again, I have heard that he is a good surgeon, but if there is any question about whether surgery is needed, seek another opinion.  I was in pain for months, needlessly, because of the misinformation I was given.  ",-1

I had not been to a doctor in about 7 years prior to going to Dr. Newcomb because I was sick of the way I was treated...appointments meant nothing, I was called in 20 minutes or more past my appointment time only to wait another 20-30 minutes in the exam room.  I have never experienced this with Dr. Newcomb.  She has even blocked off extra time if I had a new issue when making my appointment.  If you are looking for a new doctor give her a chance.  I think she is fabulous and hope she doesn't change one thing!  The reception staff and nurses have always been wonderful.  They are cheerful, friendly and always very helpful.  I know I am rattling but I think Dr Newcomb respects my time and the office prides themselves for being prompt on appointments and I have never felt rushed.  ",1
1292,35058,0.0,"When I saw Dr Newcomb for my initial (new patient) appointment, she did not introduce herself, greet me, or exhibit any of the AIDET principles of medicine practice.  I had several health concerns that I wanted to discuss but the atmosphere in the exam room was unfriendly and cold and I did not feel comfortable.  I offered Dr Newcomb copies of my medical records from my previous physician and she refused those copies, stating that she didn't &quot;think that was necessary&quot;.  That is when I, personally, lost all confidence in her.  I think my past medical history IS necessary.  While I am sure she is a competent physician, most capable of attending your health care needs, I also feel that she should be more approachable and at least introduce herself to her new patients and take a brief moment in time to just become acquainted.

1318,35072,1.0,"The following is my opinion based on a VERY SHORT visit.  He is rude, cold, and arrogant.  He offers no listening skills and determines what he thinks is best without hearing what is happening and then ends the visit.  My mother needs double knee replacement, but was made to feel as if it were her fault and he never even discussed scheduling surgery.  I would not recommend this doctor to anyone looking for a physician with any bedside manner skills or listening skills.  We will be going elsewhere for her surgery.  I rated him low on knowledge because he couldn't possibly have had knowledge of her situation since it wasn't discussed.  She received no help from him, he was late to the appointment, and his staff just seemed uncaring as well.  Maybe he is a genius in his field, but I saw no sign of that. ",-1

Turns out I had sever rheumatoid arthritis that was affecting all my joints, my lungs, my general good health.  It went far beyond one simple hip joint.  If Dr Nadaud would have listen to my complains he might have discovered this or at least pointed me to a good rheumatologist.  He only focused on the hip and ignored any other complaint I had. ",1

Dr. Nein was professional and  undoubtedly his through explanation concerning the procedure made her decision easier. Following the surgery the genuine interest in her recovery and follow-up was refreshing. She loved her new look and was amazed at how natural her breasts looked. This she attributed to Dr. Nein's vast experience and expertise. Since that time we have confidently referred Dr. Nein to several individuals and have never received anything other than positive feedback. ,1

1374,35093,1.0,I went to this doctor because I had severe foot problems.  I had been diagnosed with heels spurs and plantar fasciitis.  It was very painful to walk.  The pain was shooting up my heels and I had tingling in my feet.  I needed a medical note stating my limitations.  This doctor reluctantly provided me with a note and stated he thought I could do more than I said I could.  I then researched orthopedics and found a very good orthopedic foot specialist who acknowledged my pain prescribing a drug to treat my nerve pain that this doctor refused to even acknowledge. Eventually my condition worsened and I was referred to a neurologist who after a number of tests discovered I was suffering from MS.  I found this doctor's comments to me to be emotionally painful and very unprofessional.  I wonder if I could have reached the proper diagnosis sooner if he had just believed me.  ,-1

Thirdly, he couldn't make up his mind about what was wrong with me and what he wanted to do about it. He is very strange with really weird mannerisms. I never saw him wash his hands even after he touched my sweaty feet. He does not inspire much confidence at all. He scares me. I'm finding a different foot doctor.  ",-1

Dr. Norman was on vacation so I saw Dr. Barrett who admitted me to Baptist. My symptoms worsened so quickly that Dr. Barrett called Dr. Norman. When Dr. Norman arrived she immediately made the call for me to deliver my baby right away, my blood pressure was at stroke/seizure level (216/116)and my kidneys were shutting down. I don't know what my life would be like now if it weren't for all of their quick responses.

She never returned my calls and when I went to visit her she wanted to refer me to physch help.  I had seen several other doctors who verified that the Lupron gave me all my problems she didn't want to hear it and called me a liar. She has done this multiple times with several other patients. When my insurance company denied the injection she went behind my back and wrote to them telling them that it was our last resort and we had tried everything else. Which we never did. I wasn't a candidate for Lupron either. My asthma was enough to make me no longer qualify for the Drug.

The staff person then stated that Dr. Nawathe is very selective about whom she chooses as a patient, but when I asked specifics, was unable to tell me what criteria Dr. Nawathe uses to select patients. It seems sketchy to me that a doctor would &quot;select&quot; her patients based upon some unknown criteria (What&#63; Sex&#63; Age&#63; My illnesses&#63; What insurance I have, meaning whether her contracted rates are better with one over another&#63; What&#63;) without even meeting me.

1466,35213,1.0," he doesn't check the meds he's prescribing for side effects, so he prescribed a MAN a diuretic that also a powerful ANTI-androgen, only when the PATIENT looked it up did he correct. there have been other similar errors. the most outrageous practice is sending you for extremely painful multi-hour procedures, knowing full well you've got back, pelvic, and neural/spinal damage, NOT prescribing pain meds for the procedure (my next one is 8 hours... I emailed him twice about pain meds for it, he doesn't respond, but the mail doesn't bounce so he or his secretary IS getting it). I spent the last similar test, 2 hours strapped down in lvl9 pain, with no pain meds, when I got pulled out I couldn't situp, they had to pull me up). This time I was told to bring my own. so I begged my Internal Medicine Doc who referred me for something above and beyond the 2 5mg hydrocodones I get a day since the 2 hour test used up a full 3 days worth of meds (all types not just the hydro) he just doesn't care.

Although I was sent to him for a surgery, he was not a surgeon that was ready to throw me under the scalpel (obviously not just about the $$). He really researched my surgery, medical and medicine history. He discussed with me that my surgery would not be the easy in/out laparoscopic version and would possibly have difficulties. He also informed me that although I did have one problem ( why I was there for consult) it was possible I was having a complication from a previous surgery. As well as the fact that the results received from the one surgery may not be worth the risk of the complications. He wanted to perform some presurgery tests and be completely sure that everything was what it appeared to be before he performed any surgery.  He has 100% won my confidence and respect!!

1490,35262,1.0," This doctor was a referral from my primart physician whom I trust. My husband and I drove nearly an hour from home and had to wait nearly 3 hours to see him for 5 minutes. He immediately scheduled an appointment for an endoscopy and colonoscopy because he had no idea what was wrong with me. When we went to the hospital the following week I had not been allowed to eat anything due to the procedure and by then it had already been 24 hours since my last meal. They were two hours late getting us into the room and then another hour before he began the procedure. I had my esophogus stretched out because of narrowing, blood vessels had to be burned to stop bleeding and he found ulcers and gastritis. I was refused pain medicine even though I could swallow nothing for another 24 hours. I was unable to make my follow up appointment and they refused to tell me anything over the phone.

Upon admission to Lakeside, I was judged to be NOT psychotic or suicidal and, with my permission, the therapist phoned Dr. Utley who confirmed she didn’t know me or my husband and that she ordered the involuntary commitment as a favor to her sister who was a friend of my husband. I was allowed to leave Lakeside AMA when administration was informed that my situation would be reported to my senator, my congressman and Medicare Fraud and Abuse.    I have never had a psychiatric diagnosis and it is beyond comprehension that the unethical actions of Dr. Anne Utley could land me in a mental hospital to do a favor for a sister.

1529,35345,1.0," Dr.Urbanek will pressure you into services which are unnecessary and will not accurately diagnosis you.  You must pay in full to schedule prior to any services being rendered.  He only spends a few minutes with you and creates a treatment plan based on the most expensive services that could possibly treat your problem.  If you are a republican and a scientologist you will fit right in, if not, go somewhere else! ",-1
1530,35345,1.0," Urbanek is, in my opinion, ignorant. He seems to think his $1400 anterior occlusal device is the best in the world; most dental professionals say this causes molar eruption. He seems to think TMJ disorder is caused by stress. Most non-stress TMJ is caused by poor bite - the mandible slides to the right or left, the front or the back. The solution is bite equilibration. He did not check my bite before selling his anterior occlusal device; my mistake. My bite needed equilibration, not a $1400 anterior acrylic occlusal device. But he never checked. In my opinion this man is incompetent. Much worse, I don't think he cares about his patients. The young woman crying in his office is something I will never forget. He doesn't prescribe pain medicine - he says to use the occlusal device and the pain will go away. This only works with stress related TMJ disorder. His arrogance seems to stem from low self esteem. He does not seem capable of listening. Stay away from this man! He is poison.  ",-1
1531,35345,1.0," Absolutely horrible experience...had my wisdom teeth removed SIX WEEKS ago.  Still have excrutiating pain in my jaws.  Returned to Dr. Urbanek, and he told me that I must have had some trauma in my past because I now have TMJ.  He refused to accept responsibility for the post-operative pain and tried to sell me a $1400 brace to stop teeth-grinding.  I have never had any signs of TMJ until now, and have never ground my teeth, according to my dentist.  He is arrogant, short, and seems to want you &quot;in and out&quot; without determining the real problem.  &quot;Oh, your jaws hurt&#63;  Here, buy this brace and it will be okay.&quot;  Infuriating!  Please, PLEASE don't go to Dr. Urbanek.  My decision to allow him to remove my wisdom teeth (on the referral of my dentist) was the absolute worst decision I've ever made.  ",-1
1532,35345,1.0," He took my wisdom teeth out and it was some of the worst pain i've ever had in my life.  I didn't even have dry sockets.  His suturing was shotty and he didn't take good care of patients afterwards.  I went in to talk to him because i still had intense pain even a week later.  He refused to listen and just tried to tell me i had TMJ (which i don't have as confirmed by 2 other doctors).  He just wanted to sell me some brace.  The man only cares about money.  He is the worst doctor i have ever been a patient for.  He is the most arrogant, infuriating man i have met.  When you're done they ask you to fill out a customer satisfaction form and pressure you to give a good review.  I refused and they gave me a hard time about it.  They are the most unprofessional, untrustworthy people i have ever met that call themselves &quot;medical professionals.&quot; ",-1
1533,35345,1.0," Stay away from this inconsiderate, most arrogant man we've ever met.  He gets extremely annoyed if you have any questions.  He makes you feel that you are not worthy of being in the same room as he is.  His work is not as good as he claims it is.  The whole experience for daughter was negative.  She didn't want to go back to see him when problems arose from the surgery.  We had to find someone else that would fix his mistakes.  He has taught his nurse to treat the patients the same way he does.  Everyone is beneath them.  The front desk staff is courteous and Julie as well but Dr. Urbanek and his nurse have a terrible attitude.  They just don't care.  ",-1
1534,35345,1.0," Arrogant is the best description.  He asked me three multiple choice questions, than decided that my jaw was a disaster and must have surgery.  He was annoyed and short with any questions and criticized my dentist and orthodontist (who I haven't see in almost 20 years).  In a follow up call from one of his staff, I told the lady why I would not come back and see him.  She did not seem surprised.  I ended up going to an oral surgeon at Vanderbilt.   I used other treatment methods (no surgery) and 6 months later I'm doing great! ",-1

1537,35345,1.0," Urbanek is an arogant doctor who does not show concern for the patient.  He tries to impress you with his knowledge, but then seems annoyed by your questions.  The staff seemed more concerned about running a business than tending to the needs of the patients.  ",-1
1538,35345,1.0," Not only did I get two open sockets when he removed my wisdom teeth, after paying up front for his services, I was then mailed a bill for several hundred dollars months later for surgical removals that weren't covered by my policy. When I called the office to tell them it was a mistake because Urbanek had told me all of my wisdom teeth could be removed non-surgically, the receptionist replied with &quot;Well thats what he originally thought, but then he had to take two out surgically.&quot; When I asked why I was never informed about the actual treatment I supposedly received, the receptionist said &quot;Well you were pretty out of it when you left here so you wouldn't have understood anyway.&quot; I asked if she &quot;would be upset if a doctor performed an procedure on her that she didn't authorize and was never informed of&#63;&quot; She said &quot;maybe&quot; and promptly added- that I was still responsible for paying for these services.

I've never experience anything quite like it. We were quoted several different prices for the same procedures, noone seemed to know what things cost.  it was a complete waste of money for a $300 consultation which consisted of a discussion with the doctor, and a quick exam (5 minutes). The follow up appointment was a nightmare and I will never return. I've never seen a more uncaring, rude staff. Good thing I discovered the problem prior to spending thousands of dollars with this man. Money hungry. I was told when I called to set up an appt that if I wasn't planning on showing up, then don't make the appt. That was my first communication with the staff. Should have been my last. During the first appt, they kept on asking HOW I planned on paying for services. Horrible practice. dont trust my health to these individuals. ",-1

After that no Dr. in the practice came to talk to me and nothing further was said about fixing my problem.I was run through the mill with a P.A. writing prescriptions , but not helping when it became severe. Mistakes were made by the staff. When I finally went to the E.R. I was given medication that helped. Now that I have made them mad, I am no longer welcome as a patient.Given a story that I failed a drug test after 2 years of clean tests.I had my own test done by a private lab , it came back clean.Oh well it's as good a reason as any to get rid of someone who is not happy with a treatment that no longer works, and would like to do something to get rid of severe and unbearable pain. Never tell your doctor you think there wrong or there staff is not doing it&quot;s job. where are you DR.Valley people like me need someone we  can trust.

He got me to one of the best neurosurgeons in the southeast immediately. He is a young doctor that has upgraded his office to a paperless office, just like many hospitals now. He does not carry a computer around, he has one in every exam room. He does occasionaly look things up on the computer and I don't have a problem with that. I've had doctors, before computers, that looked things up in books while I waited (computer is faster). Jan is amazing and his nurse is excellent. If I could rate him higher than a 5 I would.  ",1

1592,35385,1.0,"I would rate it &quot;0&quot; if I could. I was referred to Dr. Van Brocklin for the removal of a broken tooth. I had to wait over 45 minutes to be seen by the first nurse, who was inept and had to take my x-rays twice. The billing secretary at the front desk was rude, and snippish. Dr. Van Brocklin then administered IV anesthesia without getting a weight/height measurement - something I thought was required to properly administer anesthesia. Finally, when I awoke, the nurse was rude, and promptly forced me out a backdoor. I ended up with Dry-Socket and now need follow up surgery to repair a bone fragment left in my jaw. In addition to the poor medical care, Dr. Van Brocklin's incompetent billing staff also misfiled my insurance paperwork and use the wrong address for billing invoices - so weeks of billing issues ensued. When I finally received and attempted to pay his invoice, he returned my check as marked &quot;void&quot; and said he had turned me over to a collection agency. CONSUMER BEWARE! ",-1
1593,35386,1.0,In my opinion this office is a mess. Dr gets angry if you ask questions. Staff really does not care if or when you are seen. The nurse is just mean spirited with never a kind word for anyone. Dr refuses to use email or talk on the telephone. His appointment schedule is always overbooked even when you arrive first thing in the morning you can expect to wait over an hour. Staff is not flexible just like the doctor. Bedside manner is just dreadful and they all act like they are doing you a favor to see you and take your money. Just a dreadful experience.  ,-1

I have many friends who also see Dr. Vick, many of whom live quite far away and will drive over an hour to see him.  I have recommended him to several people looking for ob/gyns.  I did give him a 4 on punctuality only because he is the only doctor in his office and babies don't come on anyone's schedule in particular.

He made 2 recommendations for how his office could help, and then two different staff members assured me they did not provide the services he named there! (They did have the services and provide them frequently on a weekly basis BTW) I kept asking for results of a test and eventually learned they had lost it, but I had to keep after them to find this out, even on the retest. I asked what shoes might be helpful to my foot problem and the doc stared at me and said nix. It was as though I had asked him about eyeshadow tips and I had to push for his extremely limited response.

Before he left the room, I asked him a question about my medical condition, which I have had for many years.  His answer went against all medical advice I have received from Physicians for the past 5 years, including Mayo Clinic.  In my opinion he did not like a patient asking questions.

When I finally got to my appointment, I was 15 minutes late because of a prior engagement running over- and the doctor not only would not see me, but told me he would never see me.

He is also extremely difficult to get a straight answer from. If i had a choice, i wouldve trusted my gut instinct and went to a different Dr, even if it meant having to pay out of pocket.  ",-1
1644,35405,1.0,My daughter saw this quack and he told her invitro was the only thing that would work for her.  After the first attemtp she hyperstimulated and wound up in the hospital for 5 days.  It was obvious the nurses at the hospital did not like this guy and my daughter was not his first patient at the hospital that had hyperstimulated.  He was extremely rude when we asked questions and kept saying it was not his fault.  She went to Nashville Fertility a few months later and they told her IVF should work for her.  She ended up pregnant after the first attempt.  VASQUEZ is very shady.  We have ran into several other people who have had similiar problems with him.    STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!! ,-1
1645,35405,1.0,"The office seemed to be going through a lot of growing pains. Most of their patient education was verbal. It would have helped if they had it typed so we could read it later and be able to research it onlin. I got conflicting data from the different departments. Dr. Vasquez offered FSP when my husband had 0% sperm morphology. He stated we would have a 40% success rate after we took antibiotics to get rid of a bacteria infection with FSP or could spend $15,000 for IVF and have a 70% success rate. Three weeks later after we finished the antibiotics,  was told we had no choice but do ICSI ($18,000) with a 35% success rate. Here is the kicker, we was told that there was no need to do a new sperm morphology test because there would be very little change in the morphology. So why was we told his sperm would be retested for improvements&#63;   It feels like bait and switch.  I changed fertility clinics the next day after the shock went away.  ",-1
1646,35405,1.0,"He's is expensive (almost double), but gets the job done.  His nurses are on good with relaying information.

Dr Van Nes is the best she was willing to actually take time out of her schedule because I needed to talk about my upcoming surgery.  She was willing to work with me to answer all my questions and concerns. I know I am one of the most stubborn and demanding patients.  I have had a lot of bad experiences with gyns.  I ran from the last 3 doctors before her and actually ended up being fired by the last one.  Dr Van Nes convinced me to have the surgery that I needed so I wouldn't have cancer.  I am glad that she did, even though I know I was the biggest pain with all my questions and reservations about the whole deal.  She really cares about her patients and has saved my life.  ",1

He did a good job in explaining everything to me and has many years of experience in his field so I was very confident in his ability and professionalism to handle this procedure for me.  The hospital however was a totally different story: the place was completely filthy and the staff in the recovery area beyond rude - my advice: use this surgeon and his expertise but don't go to Methodist Hospital - you're better off elsewhere! ,1

This helped explain the rest of my symptoms that my internist told me were not important. I had a full body of testing and I am in good helath now. Dr Zhou is from China and his english is broken but he went the extra yards for me and I appreciate that.

1689,35430,1.0,I have seen this doctor several times and recently he performed a colonoscopy procedure on me.  All went well with the procedure.  In his office the staff are pleasant enough but there are occasions when you will have to wait because the doctor is devoting time to other patients.  One time I waited 1 hour for him and when he came in the room I told him that I wasn't happy having to wait so long without any kind of word about his progress.  He was extremely apologetic and explained that there were patients that needed extra time.  He explained that his philosophy was to give quality time to his patients and that patient volume per day was not his goal.  He really seemed genuine in his explanation and his desire to give quality care which is what I believe he does.  I believe you will be in good hands with Dr. Zelig.  ,1

1697,35449,1.0," This doctor is on my insurance plan but refused to file the claim for my inserts. The inserts were covered by my insurance and I was told I would have to file the claim myself. I had to pay the full price up front then file, the insurance company paid the doctor less the discount he agreed to in his contract with Cigna. I called to request my refund but got the run around by his insurance person and the office manager. After 3 weeks I was told that Dr. Bachman said the refund would only be for the discounted amount. He would not give me the discount that was in his contract. In other words he is not honoring his contract with Cigna. I would never recomend this doctor to anyone.  ",-1
1698,35449,1.0," Let's be clear - this place is in business to sell expensive medical supplies.  The first visit I had a paper shoved in front of me that made me agree to purchase a $100 splint - the male nurse was irritated that I expected to read the waiver.  The doctor told me that I really needed physical therapy.  The nurse called me later to say that the physical therapy in their office is done by NON-LICENSED therapists, so my insurance didn't cover that.  The second visit the doctor never mentioned physical therapy (which was so important the first visit) and was instead pushing me to be fitted IMMEDIATELY for orthotics that are not covered by most insurance companies.  When I told this doctor that I had to think about shelling out $480 for orthotics, he couldn't get out of the exam room quick enough.  On both visits I was left in a waiting room for 30 minutes before the doctor came in.  These people are rude and condescending and I will NEVER go back.  ",-1
1699,35449,1.0, No service of any kind.  Rude and uncaring office workers.  They lie and give you the run around when you call.  They hung up on my mother and did not call her back.

I have yet to get a call back or an apology.  We will not be going back nor recommending this place. ,-1
1700,35449,1.0, Dr. Bachmann tried other treatments before resorting to surgery. I appreciate his patience with my treatment. He is very clinical and professionally engaging. He did present himself as a caring person which gave me the sense of trust in him for my personal well being.  ,1

He explained the pros and cons to this procedure in detail.  He answered all of her questions.  She only had one injection and she is now pain free.  Because of him, she was able to get her life back.  She is now able to work and enjoy life.  I thank him for giving me my mother back.  I would recommend him to anybody who wants a sincere doctor with a great bedside manner. ",1
1704,35467,0.0, Doesn't care about his patients!! Promised to be there for my post surgical pain management. Woke up from surgery in horrible pain and he could not be reached after multiple attempts. He should have been a cattle farmer because that's how his patients are treated. The staff is no better. They have crazy rules about when you can pick up meds. Lord help you if you are sick and can't pick them up or if you will be out of town. They are completely unwilling to work with you. Can't reschedule appointments the day of- not even when my daughter had an accident. I was written up as a no-show.  Stay away from this office! ,-1

1706,35471,1.0," Run from this doctor. His bedside manner was horrible, he had the gall to kiss my forehead on the way out, he started removing moles without consulting me first, and he assured me that those procedures would be covered under my office visit and that I wouldn't be responsible for more than my copay. Then I got a bill in the mail for $573. When I called to contest it the office manager was extremely rude to me, telling me that I was totally out of line to consider that they weren't going to charge me for those procedures. Please tell everyone you know that Dr. Babcock is one of the &quot;old guard&quot; doctors who is not out to do what's best for the patient, but instead to milk the system (and his patients) for as much money as he can.

So he got a a $300.00 bill. I made small payments because money was tight and he fired us as patients. I agreed he tries to make himself out to be a helpful person by raising money for other countries but he won't work with his own patients. I called his office to try to work something out but his staff was rude about the whole thing. And he wouldn't even work out anything with us. What kind of doctor is that&#63; So we found another doctor and she is wonderful.  ,1
1708,35473,0.0, If you happen to NOT have even 12.00 for the copay then you might as well go to the emergency room or die waiting till you do have money because you can't see the doctor if you don't have  the copay even though you have insurance.  ,-1

His staff is very helpful and willing to answer questions after surgery to help me make the adjustments in my new way of eating. I found that after I followed the rules and guidelines given to me by them that I have had no complications and have got my life back. I think he is very competent and would recommend him to do surgery on me or a member of my family with no doubt. I was over 300 lbs before surgery and now I weight 145. My ideal body weight. Sounds like a success story to me. ,1
1716,35499,1.0," Terrible and rude people. Frieda won't shut up about her husband, what SHE eats, what it was like to have a fat sister that died long enough for you to ask questions. Of course none of us have ever had the thinner sister that didn't mind telling us what we are doing wrong (yea right). If like me you are stuck with these people my best advice is read everything you get in your folder.  In 3 months I have saw Dr. Babineau for about  10 minutes total.  Frieda is one of those that will look right through you (we have all been there) and don't go in there in any kind of pain as a lot of us are (we already know it's because we are over weight)she literally grinned and tried to hold back a laugh at me in front of another patient.  I'm praying after I have surgery everything is successful so I never have to speak to these rude people again.  ",-1
1717,35499,1.0," Babineau does not follow specific guidelines set forth by leading surgeons when it comes to aftercare and possible leaks within the abdomen. He is most concerned with the number of patients he can get through in one day. Other doctors from Florida to San Juan to Utah, who are tops in their field, insists that there is no reason that a patient with a suspected leak should not have his/her doctor go in and correct the leaks with surgery and/or a special sealer developed for that purpose. Two East Texas doctors strongly suggested that he look at a patient who had leaks in the past, but he refused. She died  after being released for only one week from a hospital with no medical help from this doctor. ",-1
1718,35499,1.0," This doctor runs patients through like cows.  He operates and does no follow up care.

BEWARE! ",-1

1720,35501,0.0," About five months ago Dr. Lois Bachus diagnosed me with severe dysphasia and informed me that I would need a cone biopsy. So, I went in for the same day surgery. To have some emotional support, I had my husband, step mother and grandma come with me to the hospital. Now to get the whole story I need to give you some history. One month before I was diagnosed my biological mother died of a drug overdose. This was very unexpected event in my life and is still very hard for me to deal with. So I went in for my regular pap (witch was the pap that she saw the dysphasia in) and the first thing she said to me (before I told her about my mother) she commented on how much weight I have gained and how fat I am. I gained about 50 LBS after my mother passed away. After I explained that my mother had passed away she confirmed with me that it was not my step mother and I told her it was my biological mother, because Lois Bachus is also my step mother 's gyn.  ",-1
1721,35501,0.0, Dr. Bachus is one of the easiest doctors to talk to about ANY concerns you may have. The office is effecient and friendly. I feel totally comfortable recommending this doctor to anyone and at any age.  Two thumbs up! ,1
1722,35501,0.0, She is gentle with exams and attentive to my concerns or questions. She was willing to let me try natural progesterone even though studies haven't proved it helps. I have received much benefit from the progesterone and she continues to support my using it. She even consulted an oncologist to verify it was OK to continue it while taking tamoxifin for breast cancer prevention. Bottom line - she listens and cares about her patients.  ,1
1723,35507,1.0, My family saw this doctor in an emergency. Do not see this doctor. He was rude and incompetent.  It seems like he is frustrated and was taking it out on us! ,-1

1726,35528,0.0," I'm glad I read all these comments and found out I'm not alone in having a terrible experience with Dr. Bacon.  Still having an ongoing issue and was dreading going back to her. No eye contact, no listening or communication skills. When I told her I had a new problem she insisted that I told her staff that I was only following up on a previous issue and that I had told them I didn't want the new issue looked at :-O . I can't even begin to imagine what she was thinking or why. I had even put the new issue down on the intake form.  ",-1
1727,35528,0.0," First of all, yes there is usually a long wait. However, I've come to discover that it ha a lot to do with people who show up without an appointment demanding to be seen. It's also because Dr Bacon spends time with her patients. Personally I get nervous if a doctor is right on time or early... I was born with severe flat feet. I've gone to doctors my entire life for this painful deformity and never experienced relief. Dr Bacon explained my condition in a way I fully understood. She took careful and very conservative steps in treating it. Eventually we all agreed on a gastroc lengthening surgery. The surgery was quick and recovery was fairly painless...considering it was for surgery. I am 2 months post-op and overjoyed with the results. Dr Bacon and her team took great care of me. They took time to answer not only my questions, but also my parents' and husband's questions. I can't say enough about my wonderful experience.  After 26 yrs of foot pain, I'm happy to have a solution! ",1

When I asked what the heck, why 2hr wait, why $35 co/pay for nothing they tried to say its in the best interst of daughters health and wanted to offer a payment plan for the $35 co-pay.  What idiots..  I'm taking my daugher to a real doctor!! I gave this one 2 chances to many!!  Beware folks!! ",-1
1729,35528,0.0," As a trusting patient who was referred to Dr. Bacon by a friend I had a procedure that was explained to me as being straight forward. After months of continued pain post-op I realized something was wrong. After being told by Dr. Bacon that it takes time for the pain to subside I decided to seek another opinion. After consulting with two other more experienced surgeons it was clear that Dr. Bacon had made a mistake with me based on inexperience or incompetence. I have recently had to undergo additional surgery to correct the mistake Dr. Bacon made. I have not been back to her as I am very upset by this and know there is no resolution she can provide. I would avoid Dr. Bacon for any surgery that is not routine. She is probably very competent in caring for issues such as ligament sprains, bunions, or other simple conditions but for real issues with your ankle you should seek the care of more experienced surgeons downtown in the medical center.

1730,35528,0.0," I have (2) injured feet, one with breaks, one with a sprain. On my second visit after my accident she ordered X-rays on the wrong foot.(no kidding) I told the x-ray tech to no avail, he babbled something about Dr's orders......Then,  when she finaly showed up after I waited 1-1/2 hour in a waiting room past my appointment time she made up an unbelievable story about looking for previously undetected injury on the SPRAINED foot without ever x-raying the BROKEN one. Can you say QUACK&#63; Add Arogant, inconsiderate, distracted, and unable to get out of her own head long enough to take care of her patients needs and you have described my rather bizarr experience with this saw bones.

Recently, I called to schedule an appointment with him and was told that I was no longer in the system because I haven't been there in a year and a half (during which time I was pregnant and saw a doctor all the time) and that I would have to be RE-registered as a NEW patient AND that Dr. Cage was no longer taking new patients, but that I could see one of the other doctors in the office in 4-6 weeks.

When I showed up for the appointment, I was told I was late by 20 minutes even though from the time I was given by the receptionist I wasn't late. I was told I wouldn't be seen today and could I reschedule as the Dr was leaving. I called back almost an hour after appointment to find out what was going on, and found out Dr was still there. Very disappointed that they staff took no responsibility and were not helpful at all. All in all this was a very bad experience. I am in a lot of pain and will now have to find a new dr to visit.  I am sure the Dr office will stick to what they said and say it's my fault as I was late, even though I showed up at the time I was give on the phone ",-1

1740,35560,1.0," I first saw Dr. Cadenhead two years ago for vertigo and was impressed.  The problem returned recently as my insurance changed, and I now require a PCP referral. I saw a PCP, was told there would be a referral, and updated my insurance records. Today Cadenhead's staff rudely told me they wouldn't see me without the PCP referral. I was told by PCP and insurance company that as long as they have the referral # within 30 days, it's ok, but Cadenhead's staff not only refused to consider it, THEY LAUGHED AT ME.  I was in tears, nauseous and dizzy, and I'm also an existing patient, and they laughed at me when I asked them if they could delay filing my  case until they had a referral.  My PCP is referring me to another ENT.  It's worth it to wait and suffer a few more days to not have to deal with an arrogant staff that cares nothing about patients.  ",-1

I am 55 and don't have time or money to waste on someone who thinks they are so good that the office staff and bedside manners don't apply to them. He really cares about the health issues you present. If for some reason you need surgery, he has the best surgeons backing him. He's just the best doctor I've gone to hands down.

1752,35602,0.0," Run, don't walk, away from this office.  I arrived 10 minutes early  was the only patient there.  The place is filthy.  And the bldg construction is so cheap you can hear the people on the 2nd floor walk.  I was there for a consultation/physical and they had me scheduled for a pap smear.  I tried to discuss it with the receptionist but she didn't get it.  Even though I was the only one there, they took me back at 3:15.  The nurse was nice but t he equipment was SO old.   In the patients room, it was so dirty.  Dust on the examining table, torn pillow case, dirt on floor that looked like blood, dust coming out of the vents, counters unwiped.  Disgusting. Walls were paper thin...staff was loud and unruly..sounded like a frat party.  Could hear someone coughing up a lung somewhere.   I tried to hang in there but by 3:40 the doctor still hadn't come in.  I made up an excuse and left.  I've never walked out of doc office before.  Cahan can't be a good doc if she runs her office this way.  ",-1
1753,35602,0.0," In my experience, Dr. Cahan is a subpar doctor.  She has failed to diagnose more than one problem.  And she always tries to sell you herbal stuff from the office which is a clear conflict of interest.  Plus the wait time is ridiculously long.  I once have the 1st appointment in the morning and she walked in the front door late and just stood around chatting with people while I'm still sitting there.  The chatting was about personal stuff - I could hear the conversations. ",-1
1754,35602,0.0," Was very unhappy by doctors refusal to give a specific diagnosis. Had us going back 3 times in one month just to get us to buy her crappy &quot;natural remedies&quot;. Treated our 11 yr old daughter poorly and made it more difficult for our daughter to explain her symptoms. I was appalled at her unprofessional attitude and careless treatment of a patient whose parents paid her cold hard cash.  Each time we were there we felt like she was dragging on and repeating the same thing over so as to charge us the higher amount for &quot;time spent&quot; with us. Would never recommend this doctor. Her examination room was filthy, had dried up blood on the floor which she saw when she came in there and ignored. Tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but same blood spatters were there when we were put in the same room the next time we were there. Insisted that our daughter needed sleep, nothing more. Staff was very nice and helpful, Dr. Cahan, unfortunately was not. Wouldn't go back if she was last dr. on earth. ",-1
1755,35602,0.0, She is great you have to wait but that is because she does not rush her patients out the door. ,1

1758,35602,0.0," We started with Dr. Cahan for my son while on Aetna.  Our copay used to be $15, but now that we are on United we pay more.  We will try to stick it out until the employer changes companies again. I HATE the answering service and the reception staff is often dense, but Dr. Cahan is wonderful.  If you want a preventative, open-to-alternative medicine doctor, then she is the one to see.  Book a well-visit in advance since it takes a few months to get in, avoid the answering service somewhere between 12-2,and be prepared to wait 5-15 minutes in front and 15-20 minutes in back.  It's worth it since Dr. Cahan won't rush with you either and will give you her full attention.  ",1
1759,35602,0.0," The office staff is not just incompetent,they are rude and unintelligent.  IF you can get past those people, Dr. Cahan and her PA are excellent.  For me, it wasn't worth it.  Be aware, if you want copies of your records, it will cost you $25.  ",1
1760,35602,0.0," My entire family has used Dr. Cahan for 20 years. She is brilliant, combining traditional with alternative medicine. She makes you feel comfortable asking any and all questions, and she genuinely cares about you. She will fight for the best interest of her patients, even if that means speaking directly to insurance companies. She is not prideful and is quick to send you to a specialist if she feels someone else could better address your needs. I am actually looking for a new job specifically because the health insurance company with my current job (UHC) will not accept a contract with Dr. Cahan. I have tried to find a different doctor under my insurance, but there is simply no comparison. Dr. Cahan is one-of-a-kind. (The only reason I marked her down slightly on punctuality is because she is occassionally held up doing her job...delivering babies or otherwise caring for patients... but it's worth the wait!) ",1

I went to see Dr Eberle because I was having severe fatigue, headaches/head pressure, numbness in my feet and several other neurological symptoms. Dr Eberle constantly interrupted me as I was trying to explain the symptoms I was having. I told her about the numbness in my feet and her comment was &quot;so what&quot;. I told her that I was having sever fatigue and that my GP had done some blood tests to try and determine what the problem was. When I told her that my GP did not find anything in my blood tests she stated &quot;Well if your GP didn't find anything wrong then you should just go back to work.&quot; Of course that was impossible because I was exhausted beyond belief. Dr Eberle was completely arrogant and made little if any attempt to try and help me. She simply stated &quot;I don't see anything wrong with you and recommend that you go back to work&quot;. Dr Eberle recommended that I take Cymbalta (an antidepressant) for the numbness in my feet.  ",-1
1785,35631,0.0,A great disappointment. I am a 30 year survivor of Ms and recently moved to the Pearland area. I attended the infusion therapy center in Pasadena where I had to bring to the attention of the wonderful nurse Susanne that Dr. Eberle had given her the wrong prescription. This doctor was at the clinic on two of the three days I was being treated and didn't have the courage or humanity to even stop in to apologize for the error or to acknowledge my presence as her patient. As they say...she is not quite ready for prime time.Should stay in a big hospital setting with a large support staff. Perhaps she should return to physical therapy until she appreciates the mindset of today's neurology patients. We want to be participants in our care! ,-1
1786,35631,0.0,I dove 30 miles too see her one way and she kept me waiting over an hour.  I made my appt at 8:30 one morning and 8:45 the other morning on purpose so I would not have to wait.  Her staff said this would allow me to get in and out easily. Secondly the staff was rude on more that one occasion.  When I asked questions that she did not like she accused me of hiding something from her about my condition.  Nobody likes to be accused of such nonsense- especially when they are being paid for their help and for service.  After these two visits I had enough of being treated like dirt and decided it was not worth seeing Dr. Eberlee again.  Besides I wasn't going to drive all that way and wait for an hour while she had a cup of coffee and read the paper before she was ready to see me.  I found a much better physician closer to home who talks to me with respect and doesn't treat me like an idiot.  ,-1

He gave me a lot of information on it and helped me work through this condition and I have gotten much better with the pain as it is almost non-existent now. I was very glad to use him as my OB once I was pregnant and he was TERRIFIC before/during/after the delivery. It's a shame he no longer delivers babies now.

He always takes the time to answer any question even with his busy schedule.

1837,35651,1.0,"In my experience, Dr. Edmondson himself is the best. Unfortunately, his office staff is the worst. Unfortunately, that matters a lot, since the staff are the ones I have to depend on to keep up with their faxes, which include little things like Rx refill requests from my pharmacy, and my lab results from the lab, etc.  ",1
1838,35651,1.0,"Was admitted to Memorial Herman Hospital and admitted to ICU.  Among my health issues at the time, I suffer severe dibiltating migraine headaches.  I was experiencing one while in ICU and Dr. Edmundson was assigned to my care for this.  This doctor obviously cares little for his patients as I was treated poorly by him, very little dialogue between us, he wouldn't hear anything I had to say, and gave me Maxalt oral tablets that did not work because the migraine was already in full swing.  I was throwing up and in so much pain.  He refused to give any kind of pain medication, and I asked the nurse for a Decadron medicine that is a steriod that helps with my migraines and he refused that as well according to the nurse.  He was not interested in speaking to me directly and spent all of 2 minutes talking to me when I first met him.  I asked him if the Maxalt did not work what pain medications could he give, and his reply was &quot;we will see&quot;.  That is all I got.   Worst doctor for his field! ",-1

1840,35651,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Edmondson for approx. 7 years. I have never experienced anything like the others have described. There have been times when he would be called into emergency surgery and the appointments would be backed up. Dr. Edmondson offered to refer me to another doctor closer to where I live since office visits are monthly now. I know what a bad doctor is. I have experienced 3 prior doctors who in the end 2 lost their license. Dr. Edmondson was able to diagnois a condition that several other doctors missed. Some of the other doctors said it was all made up in my head. What a relief to find a doctor who believed me and actually tried to find what was wrong. I have seen some of his staff become terse with a patient but that person no longer works there. Everyone else has treated me with respect as I have treated them. It does take awhile to get an appointment because he has so many people wanting to see him because of his repetation.  ,1
1841,35651,1.0,"One Sentance: Dont go there. It's expensive to even see him with insurance over 300 dollars. Extremely long wait. It is hard to book appointments. Personally, he tried to ruin my wedding, I was the bride, and stuck in the hospital. He could have released me on friday, (wedding was on saturday) but choose monday instead with no professional reason whatsoever. Will not refer you to another doctor when needed if want another one, instead gets mad and bad list you as a patient, there is no way I can get information, surgeries, or even diagnoises from this doctor. He's bad news, and to say, he viewed me as a daughter. More like a cash cow or dog. You choose.  ",-1

I had been asking her pediatrician for years why she bent the way she did and he always said she would grow out of it. Now I know she won't and there are certain surgeries she should NEVER have. He was so wonderful my husband went to him for a hip injury. He did my husbands total hip replacement and it went wonderfully! He and his staff have always been helpful and willing to answer my questions.  We have had a wonderful experience and will use him again if we ever need anything!! ,1
1844,35653,0.0,"This man is an embarrassment to real doctors and surgeons.  After doing an extremely poor surgery for what should have been a minor cyst removal, he did the surgery again, and again, and yet again !  My husband ended up in the hospital for a week, with horrible multiple infections, the &quot;doctor&quot; NEVER gloved up while examining the open wounds, and was very unconcerned about the welfare of the patient.   Even though his patient was overweight, and over 50, he was never tested for any blood sugar problems, and was not concerned until the patient's blood sugar was 500+ !! Patient now has type II diabetes. This &quot;doctor&quot; told us he couldn't do anything more, there would ALWAYS be an open wound, and he sent us to the wound center at Brazosport Memorial Hosp.  Thank God for small favors !  They took one look at the mess, and after months, helped fix what the incompetent doctor screwed up.  What a frightening experience, and I hope no one else has to go through what we did.  What a jerk.  ",-1

I would definitely not recommend him. ",-1

1857,35660,1.0,"This doctor was supposed to perform a mini maze procedure on me for my paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Upon going in, he tore my aorta, which required emergency open heart surgery to repair it.  After coming out of surgery, I was in total shock upon noticing the massive incisions.  He didn't even have the decency to inform me as to what happened until he made his rounds the following day.  He is rude, arrogant and insensitive.  I asked him a number of questions and he got very angry and defensive.  He never gave me a straight answer as to what really happened.  My decision to go with this doctor was the WORST mistake in my life.  Complications such as a torn aorta should NEVER happen in performing a simple mini maze procedure.  This doctor almost cost me my life and I certainly would not recommend him.  My advice to anyone considering using Dr. Edgerton is DON'T DO IT!! ",-1

I rate he and his staff at the highest possible level of medical know how and caring for their patients. My experience at Baylor Heart Hospital and with Dr. Edgerton was so wonderful I told my wife if ever I had any further need for heart related diagnosis or treatment that I wanted Dr. Edgerton to be my Dr. and if hospitalization were necessary that there was no question about where I wanted to be treated. The hospitak staff and Dr. Edgerton's staff are beyond reproach as far as I am concerned.  ,1

When he put the stapes in me a week later they took them out with me having a yeast infection in my cut. They put the paper stitches on anyway they fell off by the time I got home so my mother had to butterfly my cut. I went back to  that office due to the pain in my uterus they told me that its nothing to do with them I have to go to my pcp and get something done. And it was due to having intercourse which thats not true I havent been able to get out of bed since the surgery.  ,-1
1881,35667,1.0,This doctor is terrible. My water broke at 30 weeks. Dr. Peet was the one on call but Dr. Eckhardt was the one calling shots. I layed there with no fluid and in pain asking over and over why they wouldnt take her. I was not connected to the heart monitors but two times a shift for 1 hour shift being 12 hours. The night before she showed distress but he was to busy so they played it off. Very rude and just dosent care. My baby died at 31 weeks inside me due to going into labor and her cord being compressed. If he would have done his job she would be here. She weighed 4 lbs and was beatiful.  ,-1
1882,35667,1.0,He was my the on-call doctor the weekend that I delivered my baby.  This was the WORST experience I could have ever imagined.  Never communicated anything to me and did not show up until the baby was almost delivered.  ,-1

And the best part is I can get a appt. same day if I need it.  ,1
1891,35671,0.0,Dr. Easley really is a good Dr. She does listen to you and will give you referrals without you going nuts before getting to see a specialists as long as it's warrented and she sees that. She is pretty much on schedule which is a plus but also a minus because you need to get everything in with her quickly as she only gives you a few mins at a time. you can schedule a longer appt time it may just take awhile. She is smart and if she doesn't kow why something is happenning she says so and will send you tro someone who she believes can help you. Her office is all com puterized so a script is sent via computer to the pharmacy and ready by the time you get there. a BIG plus when you don't feel good and don't want to wait an hour to get your medicine :-) !!! ,1

1894,35673,1.0,Every doctor is likely to have bad reviews. Don't let the other reviews sway you away. I was recommended to Dr.Edmunson by my pcp. He took an honest interest in my case and helped me out in a direct and honest way. I am seeing him for an acquired TBI and inattention issues.  ,1
1895,35673,1.0,"This doctor did not do what he said he would, was massively late, unwilling to talk to us about the condition we were facing, and would not prescribe a medication (non-narcotic) that had worked for this condition over and over again with prior doctors.  Arrogant, no bedside manner, couldn't be bothered to see what a past doctor had done with this medical condition.  Absolutely horrible experience. ",-1
1896,35673,1.0,Dr. Edmundson misdiagnosed my condition. He ran many tests using his equipments and did not give any report of any of the tests. He refused to correct the error of his diagnosis. He initially said was optic migraine and then told me it was a Vascular disease and then gave a diagnostic code for Loss of Vision for my insurance claim. At no point did I have or report that I lost my vision but he claimed insurance money with a diagnosis code of Loss of Vision. I only said I had flashes of light lasting for 5-7 minutes and he said he did not have a code for it. Ultimately he has not come up with any recommendation or treatment with diagnostic tests running over $1000/- I think this has to be reported or people  concerned to be aware of Doctor's carelessness and total indifference.  The doctor hang up on me saying he had no time to talk to me because he had many other patients!!!!! ,-1
1897,35674,1.0,"Punctual doctor. My appointment was right after their lunch hour so I was seen within 10 minutes after lunch. Dr. Edwards is patient, thorough, empathetic, and listens to every detail. He does not rush you nor is he in a rush. Office staff very helpful and friendly. I can't say enough about this doctor.

1898,35674,1.0,I am older and well passed my child bearing years.  I only wish I had found Dr. Edwards before my children were born.  He is so easy to talk to able sometimes embarrassing female things.  He is very caring and I have referred many people to him...they love him as well.  ,1
1899,35674,1.0,"Always thought he was a good doctor, but turns out he's a passive aggressive creep. His exams ALWAYS hurt. He said I had HPV and did two surgeries, later saying I did not have it. After complaining I got my records for a new doctor. Dr Edwards had notes in my file that said I was diagnosed with several things that I have never been diagnosed with. He refused to correct it, and unfortunately the new malpractice laws in TX made it not worth suing him for. Lynn Gibbs is a good doctor in Katy too and he said the guy was a quack.  ",-1
1900,35674,1.0,"Dr Edwards is great!  Helps you make informed decisions and is not afraid to answer your questions.

1904,35674,1.0,He delivered my higher risk pregnancy.  I think he is best when there is a problem in making you feel calm and assured that everything will be ok and doing any testing needed.  I think he does what he can to assure the mother and calm fears.  He was very compassionate.  He really knows what he is doing.  I was able to have complete confidence in his decisions for my care.  Excellent Doctor! ,1
1905,35674,1.0,"I saw Dr. Edwards for my first baby and am sad he doesn't take my new insurance, as he dcouldn't then deliver my 2nd baby.  My first prengnancy was a crisis pregnancy and that first visit, he talked to me about it with the kindest face and voice I have ever heard.  He then asked if I needed a hug!  What doctor does that&#63;  He took me trough that scary pregnancy every step of the way, and his staff was accomodating to my difficult insurance issues at the time.  Dr. Edwards will respect you for your medical decisions and appreciates when you do research on your own.  He will then help you weigh pros and cons of your ideas.  He is amazing. ",1
1906,35674,1.0,I have had 2 babies with Dr. Edwards.  He is a wonderful Dr.  He had a great bedside manner. Very thoughtful of his patients needs.  Definitely knows his stuff.  I totally and completely trust him to make the best medical decisions for me.  At the beginning of my last pregnancy he seemed to be going through some turnover with his staff so that may have been the problem for the previous reviewer but that seems to have settled and his nurses are great.  I recommend him to everyone.  I have been recommending him for the last 10 yrs since I heard a glowing recommendation from a friend.   He's the best! ,1

She was diagnosed with a bladder condition that presents similar to a cyst. She was given treatment by the specialist and cured with a matter of months. Dr. Edwards never gave up on us, helped us through this rough time, treated us with respect and kindness.

Dr. Edwards and his staff welcomed me as if I had been their patient from the beginning of my pregnancy. This was really important to me because as far as I was into my pregnancy, I wanted a Dr. that I felt I could trust eventhough we had just met.

When I showed him my main concern he told me my lips were chapped (because I subconsciously lick them continuously)and gave me an over the counter lip balm. Of course it did nothing for me so I continued to suffer with my problem. I will NEVER refer anyone to him. He is a waste of your time and money...just retire already! ,-1

1997,35710,0.0,"I completely disagree! Dr. Lisa is one of the best listeners and treatment professionals that I have encountered. Yes, I may have waited, but its worth it. She treats you like a person and not just a symptom.  One may only wait because she cares and takes time out to actually talk to each person. Also, I have been to other drs. and she is the one to properly diagnose on the first time and not waste your money on other meds. If you can become a patient you are lucky :) love you Dr. Lisa ",1

2001,35710,0.0,"Dr. Ehrlich is wonderful but her staff is abysmal.  Unfriendly.  Unprofessional.  Uncaring.  Uneducated. Totally out of line from what you expect from such a good dr. She is completely unavailable except through her staff - your message will never get through to her. Great for routine care, not for people with any issues whatsoever, staff is not qualified to answer your questions and not motivated enough to seek the answer. Shocking difference between doctor and staff people, unfortunately you see the dr. once and then are stuck in the vortex of staff incompetence for hours if you have a problem.  Very frustrating and unnecessary - there are many qualified people out there looking for work in the medical field, I wish Dr. Ehrlich would hire at least one of them.  ",1

2014,35711,1.0,"Dr. Edwards is thorough, caring, and very knowledgeable and the first medical doctor I've ever known who favors holistic medicine first prior to trying pharmaceuticals. The 4 rating for punctuality is because he spends so much time with his patients that others sometimes have to wait a while to see him. Mind, body, and spirit are all equally important  in this practice.  Dr. Edwards' in-office N.D. (Dr. Terri Beim) is exceptional as well.  Several long-term health issues have been diagnosed, treated, and resolved in the 3 years I've been seeing him and in the 6 years I've been seeing her. I recommend both highly.  ",1
2015,35711,1.0,"I was misdiagnosed by an endrocrinologist, as she was not up on the latest thyroid testing that has  been used for about 10 years now.  (Not the standard TSH, but the &quot;Free T3 &amp; Free T4.&quot;) Dr. E. said he would retest my thyroid, as he suspected it was the problem, and it was.  I had my life back &amp; lost the nearly 50 lbs. I gained.  I no longer had to starve myself to keep an add'l 10 lbs off.  I had been cutting out fruit &amp; a lot of carbs, was down to 700 to 900 calories a day &amp; was starving when I found Dr. Edwards thru ACAM.org.  I never had a weight problem &amp; was called a tall stringbean, so when I gained all that weight for no apparent reason, it was so puzzling.  Thank God Dr. Edwards is a cutting edge doc! ",1
2016,35711,1.0,"$2000 later, nothing has changed.  I saw Dr. Moore at the clinic of Dr. Edwards so they are affiliated.  When I called, the receptionist asked if I had a hormone problem.  I find this extremely unprofessional, for the secretary to ask someone to diagnose themselves.  Furthermore, I couldn't afford this saliva test they wanted me to take since I'd already spent about $1500 in 2 weeks (I'm a student), and the guy was completely uncompromising, pretending the financial issues didn't exist and berating me for not getting the test that I said I couldn't afford.  Soo, apparently if you are not super rich you get treated poorly and they don't want you there.  Also, they never really fixed my problems.  They told me I was allergic to peanuts, which I'm not.  I have since figured out my issues for myself via internet research and contemplation, and honestly I've helped myself much more than they did.  ",-1
2017,35711,1.0,Dr Edwards has helped me considerably with hormonal issues.  I have also elected to take chelation therapy to remove toxic heavy metals from my body.  I have been feeling better since taking this therapy.  Dr Edwards I believe is an excellant Christian doctor.  I am glad I found him and appreciate the medical advice and treatment he has given me.  His associates and staff are second to none.  ,1
2018,35711,1.0,"I have been abused by the &quot;general MD population&quot; (and the scams we used to call health insurance) for decades, but there have been a few that earned my respect and gratitude. That was before I found this doctor. This man has EXPERIENCE and RESULTS superior to and beyond my wildest imaginings. I now am excited about living my life since he and his organization have restored my health. Their approach is truly holistic. He cares about your soul. He has proven my suspicions, confirmed problems, and delivered complete solutions. I am in awe that everything without exception they gave me or guided me to do has worked. This is tested against a very harsh standard or contrarianism where I expect the results to prove themselves. With this office I have had both experiences of using UHC and now being uninsured, and the ONLY issue that has turned up in about ten months of visits is incompetence from UHC. If you want to feel good and feel good about life, you should consider Dr. Edwards ",1
2019,35711,1.0,I was so thrilled to finally find a doctor that would really listen to me. Not spend five minutes with me and then rush out the door. Dr. Edwards was very warm and caring and spent a lot of time on my visit. He knew exactly what I needed and for the first time in years I'm feeling like a normal human again. ,1
2020,35711,1.0,"I don't recommend this doctor. Don't want to go into details, but he wanted to do tests that were obviously unrelated to my condition. When I called him on it he was defensive, and could give no reasonable explanation. Don't waste your money or time with this one.  ",-1
2021,35711,1.0,"I generally do not like doctors. However, Dr. Edwards is definitely the exception. He is kind, knowledgeable, compassionate and actually LISTENS to what you have to say. He spends at least 20 minutes with me at every office visit, versus the usual two minute poke-and-prod you get from most other doctors. He combines medical and alternative treatments to come up with the healthiest treatments for the body. He has a mind-body approach that is very effective. I find him to be very forward-thinking and he is an excellent physician. ",1

2030,35715,1.0,I told this Dr.that my insurance would soon expire and an appt. was made immediately for a checkup. He told me I had a chipped filling &amp; it needed to be replaced which he did. I told him when he finished that it did not feel right.He smoothed it out a bit but I told him again that the fit was not right.He assured me that it was. That night I experienced pain &amp; since Dr. was out of town(he has no one to cover for him) I went to ER room(4:30 AM) where a RX for pain &amp; infection was given.I called Dr. the next day as I was still in pain. He drove back to Houston (a short distance; this was the $100 charge)and referred me to a periodontist who found that surgery was needed to correct the problem. I feel that had the initial treatment been performed correctly (if it was actually necessary)I could have avoided the pain and anguish from his treatment as well as the surgery to correct the problem whih resulted in more pain and discomfort. I will not return to Dr. Edwards.  ,-1

2041,35717,1.0,"Creepy Man, I asked him questions and he looked nervous, he said all his patients have not complained...I instanstly felt he was trying to convince me of this because he stuttered when he said it. I came home to find reviews on him since I was dissapointed with the consultation and now I know he will not be the one I choose. I should've looked him up before going into the consultation I would have saved myself $60.00. He was not informative, very quiet, nervous, and rushed in and rushed out. Consultation lasted about 15mins total. Did not show me before &amp; after pictures of other patients as it says on website! That was very odd! I recommend you look elsewhere and if you don't believe me please go to the consultation and learn for yourself how creepy he is and how nervous and quiet he is and how he only stays for 15mins with you. Very dissapointed and I feel dumb now for not doing research on this guy before going in to my consultation!His staff the nurses were great but he was strange! ",-1
2042,35717,1.0,"DO NOT USE THIS DOCTOR! He is HORRIBLE! I've seen him dozens of times and sat in his waiting room no less than 45 min each time, and the max of FOUR HOURS! Absolutely no bedside manners, he's cold hearted and pushy. He disfigured me, I have to have reconstructive surgery to fix his mistake...  I'm not going to go into what happened, because if I mention it, it obviously leads to my identity. Just don't use him. Save yourself the heartache and pain.  ",-1
2043,35717,1.0,"Im actually shocked at the other responses. I had a consultation with him about rhinoplasty and the only thing that i didnt like was the 1 hour wait. Other than that he answered every question I asked even about 2 lawsuits (that were dismissed) that I'd printed up and brought with me. And yes, he did try to leave at the end without me asking a few more of my questions but I said &quot;Are you leaving&#63;&#63;&quot; He said &quot;yes&quot; and I replied &quot;No you cant escape...I have more questions!&quot; He found humor in that and he came back and finished the consultation to my liking. And when I asked him if i could watch a surgery live, he said no because of insurance purposes, but he even found me a dvd of an actual rhinoplasty surgery and let me watch it in one of his offices. Maybe he has realized the error of his ways and is trying to be nicer to his patients. This happened on 1/8/09. ",1
2044,35717,1.0,Michael Eisemann has a serious problem that he does not care about his patients. He did nasal surgery(Bad) and he had me dripping nasal fluid for 4 weeks until I complain he then I was taken from his office to ICU. I was there for 5 days with in sevral IV's taking high doses of antibiotics and a stint in my back draining the fluid to ease the pressure off my nose so it could heal. Over all I was in the hospital for 9 days. He did never apoligise that he had misdiagnose my nose dripping. I think the medical board should take his liscense away.  ,-1

She had a total of 8 pints of blood, kidney failure, on a ventilator for a week, pneumonia, etc. She almost lost her life. Dr. E tried to blame everything on something else and never took blame for anything. He had to do a second surgery to remove coagulated blood. He is the most cold, insensitive doctor I have ever come across. Please, please, if you still are considering this type of surgery do not use Dr. E. ",-1

2054,35721,1.0,"Dr. Ebling was recommended as a top practitioner for Keratoconus. I'm convinced that is quite valid. He purports to treat many dozens each month. He purports to give lectures to peers on Keratoconus treatment. He purports to have a great deal of data and experience on many brands of contact lenses, allowing him to diagnose the most effective and problem free. I have found him to be highly effective in each of these regards. I have been unable to match his level of specific knowledge and effectiveness (with Keratoconus) in the Dallas area - so much so that I annually travel from Dallas to Houston and burn a day of vacation solely for his care (that's how significant I consider his care to be). Additional notes: his daughter Karen is also in the same practice. This is a standard office with staff for scheduling and insurance utilization. All pleasant and professional. ",1

Has never been thourough. Her staff is the most unprofessional group. Several years ago I referred a family to this practice, they went once and told me they would not go back. They were unhappy with Dr. Eisner's entire office experience.  They felt everyone was rude and the Dr. was &quot;stand-offish&quot; to their children. I would NOT reccomend Dr. Eisner.

2087,35735,1.0,"Facello is a great doctor. I met him at the start of his career and he took his time with me. I felt that he cared immensely. His demand became such that his time was compromised. Toward the end of his career I did feel that he didn't spend as much time per patient but it comes with the territory and it seems that he had personal issues. What I will say is that he adjusted my back with precision in minutes and healed 4 years of pain.. He was always appropriate with me and he quelled my pain. It is a shame that he has lost his license to even practice chiro.

2093,35736,1.0,"I do not question Dr. Fakhri's skill, knowledgge, or ability, but every interaction that I had with his administrative/office staff has been terribly unprofessional and unorganized, from entering my name in their computer system two different ways to having two different staff members set me up with two different sleep study facilities (for the same sleep study!).  When I finally contacted them to schedule my surgery (about a month ago) I was told that they would have to call me back.  Never heard back from them.  Not surprising at this point and the list goes on...and trying to have my medical records sent to a different doctor has been no easier.  I have had to call the office numerous times for that.   I do not recommend based on poor administrative processes.  ",-1
2094,35736,1.0,I have been suffering all my life with fungal polyps and had many surgeries. I was finally sent to see him. I never knew how complex my condition was until he explained it to me. He fixed my sinuses and my quality of life is so much better. ,1

He dilated my eyes, I had a reaction, and passed out.  He told me I needed to eat- that my blood sugar was probably low.  I later found out that I had a reaction to the dilation.  I felt that he was completely dishonest with me about this.  Also, the staff was not efficient- I was told 3 or 4 different amounts that I owed, and finally just paid to get out of there.  Since then, they have been very difficult to work with- ordering contacts, getting copies of my prescription, etc.  Never friendly on the phone.  ",-1

He doesn't take any crap and won't sugar coat the reality of your health just to make you feel better. His concern isn't that you come out of his office feeling all hunky dory, but that your health concerns are addressed with a firm plan of action to correct, treat, and prevent present and future complications. Highly recommended, even if you have to drive to Vidor to get to him. ",1

2119,35749,1.0,"I blind chose Dr. Farnie from a list. Normally when I am there I see 3-4 students, which is ok but I expect to spend time with my physician alone to discuss my case - not happening. The person who I though was a nurse is actually a unprofessional medical assistant with no knowledge of policy, procedures or handling workman compensation cases. All my paperwork was incomplete and I had to constantly call over and over for 5 weeks to get paperwork completed while I am off work and NOT recieving a check! Need forms completed to return to work - this process again is a simple, but the person whom I thought was a nurse dropped the ball again. Dr. Farnie never returns your calls, he do not take the time to communicate with the patients he talks to the students instead and he is the worst on federal workman compensation cases. I do not recommed him at all. It is like a 3 ring circus trying to get a straight answer, paperwork complete or any professional help.  Find someone else! ",-1
2120,35749,1.0,Dr. Farnie and his staff was extremely helpful. I didn't have to wait in the patient room for a extended period of time the doctor came right in and went to work. He check all points and made sure all basis were covered.  ,1
2121,35749,1.0,Farnie is competent and compassionate. The use of a resident/medical student for the primary examination is because this is a medical school clinic. You basically get the knowledge of two doctors for the price of one. I have used Dr. Farnie for more than five years. I have found him responsive to my concerns. He takes the time to explain procedures and conditions. I would recommend him and University of Texas Physicians highly.  ,1
2122,35749,1.0,"A resident did my exam.  The resident did an excellent job, but unfortunately the problem I had (have) was still unresolved.  I called back to find out what I should do next to get the problem solved.  I was told by a nurse that Dr Farnie said that there was NO plan for me.  I said well I need help for this problem.  She said they already did a test and it was not what they thought so sometimes we have pains that just don't go away.  I told her to tell Dr. Farnie I needed help and it wasn't just some silly pain.  She grudgingly got him to agree to a referral but he had no interest in my problem whatsoever.  He barely looked at me or listened to me for more than 2 minutes or so and completely left everything up to the resident.  I changed insurances so I could get my sweet doctor back that I had before.  I do NOT recommend this one.  ",-1
2123,35749,1.0,He might know but he won't see you. You have to deal with a student and he just approves whatever the student says. He does not examine the patient neither explain anything. He does not return calls or follows up on treatment. The whole thing feels like a circus. Horrible experience. I won't recommend to my enemy.  ,-1

He is the most wonderful doctor I have ever encountered and possibly the most wonderful man. He is very easy to talk to,explains everything completely and in a way that can be understood. A year after my twins he delivered my son and 10 years later he delivered my beautiful baby girl who is now 6 weeks old and he did so beautifully. In my opinion he is the best Dr. in his field of expertise. He is a Master of the Medicine that he practices. No other doctor could even come close to comparing to him. There is not enough time to tell you how wonderful of a doctor this man is but he is. ",1

2138,35757,1.0,Have to say my experience with Dr. Falk was tremendous.  He is one fo very few doctors that still take their time getting to really know their patients and put any concerns at ease.  My first visit to im was a good hour and the first half of it was he and I in his office just so he could learn about me and any concerns I had.  He is a fantastic doctor and I am proud to say he delivered me as a baby and would have him deliver all of my children if he were still delivering babies but he no longer does that..He is fantastic for all other needs.

Doc Ron told me up front that this wasn’t going to be an easy fix and never made false promises during the adjusting stages of treatment. I can honestly say it was a long battle over the years and anything at this point was an option and thank god i went to the right guy cause it truly makes a difference. After a few months of treatment I feel so much better , I can sleep all night without the pain, most of all I can do my job without the agonizing constant pain I have felt for years.

2177,35770,1.0,"Dr. Farmer is wonderful. After many doctors and tests, he finally diagnosed an issue I've had for over 16 yrs. Your intial appointment will take at least an hour as he will take you into his office to talk with you about what issues and concerns you're having. He will ask lots of questions and encourage you to ask many as well. Be honest with him, no matter how personal or embarrassing his questions. He will then examine you based on your discussion with him. He really cares about each patient and his staff is very kind and helpful. Wonderful OBGYN. Excellent Reproductive Specialist.

I had 2 procedures done with Dr. Farmar not to mention all my annuals. She is usually running behind so be prepared to wait but like the other posts said it is because she will take the time with you once you are in the exam room.

She gave me the signs to watch for, I knew what to expect before, during and after the procedure and all went as planned. Her nurse called me this morning to check on me and honestly, I wasn't surprised to hear from them. Her whole staff is so upbeat, happy to see me when I walk in the door, remember me by name and they all genuinely care about their patients. Even the woman I spoke to for the equipment company that brings the Novasure machine said she was thinking about switching to Dr. Farmar as her own Dr.!

She is extremely knowledgeable,empathetic, patient, and above all, extremely skilled. She is a little meek and quiet, but I feel like she is truly listening to every concern I have.

She has preformed 2 surgeries on me, one being removal of my appendix, and made the tinniest incision so you can barely even tell I had anything operated on my stomach!! Her technic is flawless and she actually listens and cares for her clients, at least from my experiences with her. She would always call me back with any questions I had and made me feel very comfortable during exams.

Also, I called her office one day when I had spotting at the beginning of my pregnancy. She called me back instead of a nurse. She made me feel a lot better and even had me come in for an ultrasound on the following business day! She's never rushed me through an appointment.

After a quick physical exam, checking my pulses, he suspected I had a coarctation of the aorta.  The CT scan confirmed it and he recommended surgery.

2211,35781,1.0,"Careless, prolongs diagnostic and office visits when he knows that one test will determine the need for surgery.   During rotator cuff surgery, the loop that holds the tendon out of the way was not removed causing severe pain and potential nerve damage.   Complete wanton negligence.  The office staff is rude.  They won't even work with you on an insurance billing issue so that they can get paid for surgery.  I have used the group of doctors in the past and recommended the office.   That trust is destroyed.  ",-1

She didn't seem to care about me as a person at all. I also had MANY problems with her not calling in prescriptions, giving the wrong amount of refills, and even charging me for calling in a prescription because I was due for an appointment (even though I already had one scheduled at the time).

Then my 76 year old father went (it was close for him) and they messed up his blood work twice as well.  The first time they lost it (LOST IT!) and the 2nd time they didn't draw enough for the test (DIDN'T DRAW ENOUGH!)--These are professionals&#63;  Run far from this practice.

This doctor went to great trouble to become a provider for our new insurance when we had to switch to a new company.

Her front office staff is unfamiliar with policy and procedures. She was argumenative, and her bedside manner I found to be quite cold. I was very displeased with how I was treated.  ",-1
2230,35792,0.0,"This doctor was very short with me, and her bedside manner was atrocious. She failed to discuss options for how to treat any of my problems. She gave me the name of a psychiatrist, when that is certainly not what I needed. I would never visit her again, and would strongly encourage others to seek a different doctor. This was hands-down the worst experience I have ever had with a doctor.  ",-1
2231,35793,1.0,"Dr. Farris a very judgemental individual who sets certain criteria in his own mind about who is the &quot;perfect patient&quot; and who he will accept.  If you have pain medications prescribed by a pain speicilist he will degrade you and ostracize you for taking the medication though you are obviously not overmedicated.  You can walk in alert and oriented, walking perfect, talking fine, and acting normal and NOT HIGH.  But when he sees you take pain meds he throws you out of his office and refuses to run any tests to find out what diagnoses you may have that is causing your pain.  He is the poorest excuse for a doctor I have ever met.  He has no compassion and is judgemental with a god complex and is all knowing though he has never met you before.  He refuses to communicate with the patient and judges you by the paper you wrote on. ",-1

The billing lady especially is very very rude and mean. Very difficult to deal with when you are worried about your child. It is too bad since Fader is such a nice guy.

2237,35798,1.0,"Dr. Farhat was the first doctor to actually find the root problem of my pain, and performed deep shots that has kept me off of pain medication for one to two years at a time.  All previous specialists I've been to has only prescribed physical therapy, TENS unit therapy, pain medications,... which lowered the pain, but never removed the pain as Dr. Farhat has done.  ",1
2238,35798,1.0,"I went through many referrals to physical therapy with TENS units to all sorts of medicine, but upon referral to Dr Farhat, he diagnosed the actual problem causing my back pain when all others did not.  He stopped all my back pain for 2 years with a single deep shot and I went off all pain meds during that time.  Since then, that type of shot does not work well for me anymore, but the trigger point injections totally relieve my pain for months.  He and his associate team together where the other is the anesthesiologist.  He is patient and takes the time to explain everything to you. He is of the opinion that surgery is the very last resort when all else fails.  I would highly recommend Dr. Farhat.  ",1
2239,35798,1.0,Dr. Farhat simple could not understand the pain issues and gave advice that was incorrect. He is not very knowledgeable about pain management and has very little concern for the patient. He was eager to move on to his next patient and was not focusing on his current patient's needs.

Dr. Farhart was so good at finding out the source of my pain and managing my pain so that it was not out of control.

What may have been an inconvenience for Dr Fairbanks was a humiliating and demeaning situation for my 16 yr old son that caused ongoing repercussions. What Fairbanks is stating could all be protocol and correct..but his mannerisms, demeanor, tone were completely unprofessional and belittling. This would have been one thing to do to me…but to make a 16 yr old kid feel even worse about a very sensitive situation is unacceptable and completely beyond my realm of comprehension. There are many more detail that will not fit onto here. Fairbanks response was filled with semantics and no apologies.

I would highly recommend Dr. Farnam to any female needing to see a gynecologist for help in getting her gynecological problems corrected.  In closing, I have to say his office staff is the best I have ever run acoss - they are all nice, helpful and efficient workers.  ",1

I appreciate that he is empathetic, but also allows the patient to take control of their health by providing all of the available options.  From the time you walk into the waiting room the receptionist is polite and greets you with a smile.  The wait isn't bad at all, because I don't mind waiting for the best.  The entire office staff is pleasant, friendly, outgoing, and compassionate.    I had a complete hysterectomy and every other doctor I went to advised me that I would have a huge scar and would be off of work for 8 weeks, because of how extensive my surgery had to be, because I had such an enlarged uterus.  I appreciate Dr. Farnam, because he first looked for other options to reduce the size, then we later decided on the robotic surgery.  I recovered quickly and was back to work in 4 weeks.  Best of all, you wouldn’t even think that I had surgery, because it has only been about 4 months and there is hardly any scarring.  ",1
2269,35815,1.0,"There are not enough words to begin to express how grateful and appreciative I am of Dr Farnam and his staff.  He is an amazing doctor, who exemplifies compassion and commitment to excellent care for his patients, he has such great humility and he really cares about your well being but most of all he LISTENS to  your concerns.  I recently had  a  partial  hysterectomy performed by Dr Farnam due to multiple Fibroids that I had suffered for many years. I have had past surgeries from different doctor for the removal of the Fibroids, they continued to reoccur so   I knew the  decision to have a partial hysterectomy  had to made sooner than later. By speaking with Dr Farnam  he explained what the surgery entailed, which made me  feel at ease, and at peace in making my final decision to have the partial hysterectomy.     I as well as my family are so appreciative of Dr Farnam and very grateful.   There is no other doctor I would want to render my care. Dr Farnam is one of the best...  ",1

That’s what I had, and if you have to have this operation, I’d highly recommend you consider using Dr. Farnam and the single-incision method. Twelve hours after surgery I was up and walking. After three days the swelling and bruising were starting to diminish. I was going up and down stairs after 3 days. Pain pills were taken for about 4-5 days, but I felt better each day. Nine days afterward, most people can’t even detect that I had any surgery at all. The nursing staff at Las Palmas was outstanding, too.  If you have questions or doubts, listen to this doctor and not the horror stories of what happened to Aunt Edna years ago.  ",1

He also didn't take out ANY nodes.  Now I have to get hormones and radiation.  Be wary of anyone that promises you the world.  Prostate surgery is heavily advertised, but some of the surgeons doing it only care about getting as many patients done as possible.

The only feed back that I would get was a comparison of other patients my age who had sever cases, belittling me and making me feel like I was crazy. I had constant upper back pain and stiffness and he prescribed 5+ different pain killers and muscle relaxers through out the two years. The root cause was never addressed or investigated by him. I finally bucked up and saw a new doctor. On the first visit I got an x-ray of my pelvis and lower spine which was never done at Fan's office. After an MRI I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis by my new doctor, I had seen him for only 2months at this point. Dr. Fan does not listen to symptoms and evaluate signs in an investigative manner. As far as seeing him to seek a diagnosis, do not see him. He is cold, stubborn, and belittling. ",-1

The doctor did not tell us this nor did he tell us what to expect. After a week of total depression a return visit only resulted in xanax which made him totally depressed.

We have been through some really trying times with our health and our emotions in the past 11 years and Dr. Bob and his staff have seen us through it all.  I think a true test of how well a doctor treats people is how much his staff turns over.  Dr. Bob has had the same staff for well over 5-7 years and some longer.

He performed the surgery and I when I awoke I knew something was wrong, it hurt real bad. I went through six months of rehab with little improvement and less on the pain. He cut me off of my pain meds saying that the reason that I was hurting was because that I was addicted to the vicoden. I never got full range of motion and went for a further four years in pain and knee coming out of socket constantly. I finally got my senses together and found a doc in Ft. Worth (Dr. Stephen Brotherton) who does true sports medicine (professional rodeo, ballet, and the TCU athletics program).

Also, I weigh 250 lbs. 5'6&quot; which they said was too obese to do the reflux surgery but they would be more than happy to sell me a gastric bypass surgery.

She ran other tests and said he didn't need ANY surgery. She even said &quot;this borders on malpractice.&quot; This doctor apparently has no conscience and will operate on children just for the money when there is nothing wrong with them. I am a bariatric patient with another doctor myself.

P.A. conducted complete interview and full compliment of neurological tests, then told me she had no ideas what was causing the tremors, but it was not Parkinsons.  Then she said I had sleep apnea and proceeded to do a sales job to get me to come back for an overnight sleep test.  I have no trouble sleeping without snoring, and test my O2 frequently, never finding it below 92 when I wake up at night.  My wife is a light sleeper but never notices snoring or any sign of apnea.

2348,35932,1.0," I know this forum request that you are polite when telling them why you rated the doctor in this way, but in all honesty I have NOTHING nice to say about this doctor or his sorry excuse for staff. I had seen this doctor previously when I was pregnant and he perscribed medication that could do some major damage to my lil one, didnt mention side affects, oh and perscribed it after it was RECALLED! I didnt go back to him for a few years until recently. I would have rather taken a mellon baller to my brain than deal with them ever again but it was a medical emergency and just my luck he was the only office willing to take an emergency. His staff has lied, lost paper work, lied again, and this excuse for a doctor defends their incompitance.

2352,35938,0.0," My family has/have been patients of Dr. Kahan for eight years and I was shocked to see less than a 5 star rating for her.  There should be another category for accessability and responsiveness for which the doctor would gather more 5 stars.  Clearly she has been &quot;graded&quot; unfairly.  She is a five doctor, nothing less. ",1
2353,35938,0.0," We have been going to Dr. Kahan for several years now.  Our son (18 when we started treatment &amp; now 23) has a severe case of Tourettes &amp; OCD and many of the co-morbid conditions that accompany these disorders.  We have experienced care from many providers before finding Dr. Kahan and were very frustrated with the lack of knowlege and care we received from them.  Dr. Kahan has been a God-send to our family!  She is knowlegeable, caring, committed, encouraging, thorough, informative, and supportive. She has recommended material to help us understand what our son is experiencing and how we can help him better deal with it.  She listens &amp; is always open to information we have researched; and if she does not have knowledge of it at that time, will research it and get back with us with her opinion based on the information she gathers.  She has been completely available and walked us through crisis.  God has used her to spare my son's life and the help him have a healthy &amp; productive future.  ",1
2354,35938,0.0, I took my teenage daughter to see Dr. Kahan.  She is a nice Dr. and she probably is helpful for cooperative patients but she did not try very hard to make a connection with my daughter and so was not very helpful to us.  She also did not have a lot of insight for me as the parent when I would describe what was happening.  I would not recommend her for teens.  She was nice and on time and may work for straight forward cases with adults.  ,-1
2355,35938,0.0, I was able to discuss my symptoms and felt that Dr. Kahan was interested in what happened to me. I saw her and continue to see her for some depression and anxiety. ,1
2356,35938,0.0," Dr. Kahan was absolutely horrible.  I have Bipolar and OCD, and had only been diagonsed for a year with OCD when I started seeing her.  I always felt rushed to get through the appointment, and I felt like my opinions didn't matter to her; she definitely had a superiority complex.  To top it off, when my OCD got bad enough to necessitate going to a hospital, she had me placed in a shoddy mental instituation for FOUR DAYS without a single contact from her - the doctor I saw there was supposedly a &quot;friend&quot; of hers, but Dr. Kahan did nothing to help ease a very scary period in my life.   In short, do yourself a favor - don't see this doctor! ",-1

Once you meet him its like you have known each other all your life.( he just has that kind of personality) I have now been a patient of Dr. Kadi's for two years.I was diagnosed with breast cancer so due to that it was recommended to have a bilateral mastectomy. My reconstruction in now completed it looks and feels great!! I am VERY satisfied with the outcome. The office visit waits NEVER took longer than 15 min.He ALWAYS made me feel as I was the only patient. It didn't matter how many questions I had He would answer them all. Never one time did I feel rushed. The office ladies very polite and sweet. The hospital stays were good.I never had to wait on Dr.Kadi the next morning.He was ALWAYS there bright and early. He had great bedside manners. Not one time did I have a bad experience in the care of Dr.Kadi. This sums up Dr. Kadi with me as a patient--Curiosity, compassion, diligence, connection and communication ",1
2362,35945,1.0, Dr Kadi did a wonderful job on my surgery.  I was and still am very satisfied with his work. His staff Is very knowledgable and helpful.  I have several friends who have gone to him and were also very satisfied. ,1
2363,35945,1.0," Dr Kadi removed a skin cancer in my husband's hairline near the temple. The &quot;plastic surgery&quot; resulted in a lopsided hairline (one side is now shorter than the other). When he went to have the stitches removed, one had popped and the wound was seeping. Dr Kadi removed all the stitches and sent my husband home with a gaping, seeping wound. We applied antibiotic ointment to help it heal, but now there's a big scar. We spent the extra $$$ to have a plastic surgeon minimize the damage to my husband's face - you wouldn't know this looking at the resulting hairline and scar. I would NOT recommend Dr Kadi.  ",-1

2369,35956,0.0," I went to Dr. Kaimann several years ago.  I am a person dubious with psychology/psychiatry in general as it never seemed to help anyone in my family much before (depression), but Dr. Kaimann hung the moon, as far as I'm concerned. VERY supportive, knowledgeable and therapeutic. If only I could still afford her... ",1
2370,35956,0.0," Dr. Kaimann spent a lot of time with my son and I and is very knowledgable, patient, and kind.  I wish she would have spent a little more time before coming up with her diagnosis, but the school was paying her so I guess I couldnt expect much more. ",1

2376,35969,0.0," I wk overseas as a contractor and I am only home for less than 30 days. I went to visit Dr.K for a pap smear as well as a routine follow up. I waited for a long time in the lobby, then went to the room only to wait a long time. Dr. K came in and did the pap smear really quick and did not want to hear about my concerns. I felt she was in such a rush that she caused me to forget what I was going to talk to her about knowing I wrote all my concerns down on a paper. I then told the staff that she was rushing to leave the room, I forgot to mention my other concerns with them. I explained to the receptionist how I felt about Dr. K and said she would explain to Dr. K my concerns. I then turned in my prescriptions, which were wrong. I went on a trip out of state the next day,realized the meds were incorrect. I called to explain to the receptionist how I felt about my visit.  A few days later, I received a certified letter in the mail stating they will no longer see me(30days advance notice) ",-1
2377,35969,0.0, The office is not clean. Her NP is very rude and has no idea how to treat patients. You wait forever and then half the time they don't even help you. Do not waste your time with this clinic. Very bad bedside manners.  ,-1
2378,35969,0.0," After numerous mistakes, I finally changed healthcare providers as I got fed-up with her constant errors and incompetence. She “forgot” to record previous prescriptions that she had written for me &amp; then proceeded to give me the WRONG prescription. She also had ordered some unnecessary and unauthorized tests that were then billed back to me at $110. Apparently got me mixed up with another patient(!).  VERY dangerous dealing with this doctor!! ",-1
2379,35969,0.0," I hate the fact that I am reduced to a number when called instead of my name. If you think that you go and out in under 2hrs. you are sadly mistaken. Chances are you will still be waiting to see the doctor. One appt. the doctor was taking off early and they change my appt. to a early time that day and didn't even asked me! I had to set 2 to 3hrs just to see her and that is with the appt. Then she writes me a script for the only med that I am allergic to. I spent 3hrs, reduce to a number and another 30mins waiting in the room just to get a med order I can not take. No thanks Doc.  ",-1

He has but not only my son who is not 14 months old, but me and my family through HELL! He has no business being a dr!!!!! ",-1
2384,35972,1.0, Dr. Kabir has been so wonderful. He explains in detail the process and answers all of my concerns. He has gone up and beyond as a Physician and showed me that Doctors do care.. The wait time for the office appointment can get long but the staff and his PA makes it very comfortable and it is worth the wait. I highly recommend him as a Doctor..Thank you for everything...  ,1
2385,35972,1.0, This doctor is highly competent and EXTREMELY well informed. he is supersmart nad sometimes talks too fast but if you ask him to slow down he will. He looks at the complete picture and really cares about patient outcomes. His knowledge is not restricted to his specialty. Have long wait times but thats because he talkes his time with patients and sometimes has emergency deliveries of babies. OT be expected so I dont mind. I have referred many of my friends to him and all are thrilled.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND ,1
2386,35972,1.0," Dr. Kabir has good bedside manner, but it doesn't make up for the experience I had there.  He never gives a straight answer and is always rushed.  My first visit, I wasn't seen for 1 1/2 hour after the scheduled time.  I decided to give him a shot thinking that maybe he was in a delivery, etc.  My next bad experience came when I called to get a script (prescription) for a flu shot.  The front desk told me I didn't need one and go somewhere else to get my flu shot.  Lazy!!  I ended up getting the script but not for another few days.  The final straw was when I called for info on the H1N1 shot.  The front desk was rude, and said they didn't have any info.  I found a clinic on my own and needed a script to get it.  I called in the morning and asked if I could get one the next day and was told it would be ready for me in the morning.  I walked into the office (full of patients) and I was told they weren't able to get the script and that they didn't know what time he would be in.   AWFUL!! ",-1
2387,35972,1.0," He is a very good, caring, and knowledgeable doctor.  He answers all my questions, but he does talk fast.  My first visit, I talked to him for 2 hours and he answered everything.

2389,35972,1.0," Ultrasounds are done every two weeks and office worker told me that they aren't trained ultrasound techs in office - they are the ones doing the ultrasounds (not good). Had 2 major problems with office scheduling. Some office workers aren't very competant. Usually wait times to be seen are excessive. They have a physician assistant that the office workers and doctor refer to as a doctor.  She is a P.A. and not a doctor, but yet she wears a doctors coat with the title doctor on it. Totally unprofessional.  ",-1

Paid/Co-pay:$200",1
2396,35987,0.0, He made my infant go to a specialist and have xrays done when even the specialist himself told me he should not have sent us to him. Kahn was rude to me.

2404,36000,1.0," Dr.Kahan is the best which probably accounts for why the wait time is sort of long. He spends as much time with his patients as needed. He makes you feel like you are his only patient. He's also very knowledgable with his diagnosis, evaluations and prognosis. ",1

2410,36018,1.0," My sister had been seeing Dr Kahn for a few month. I took her to her appt. one day, and was shocked. It was so obvious that most people were there just to get meds. The second review is exactly what I saw. Dr. Kahn came in for a minute to sign the scripts. The staff was the rudest I have ever seen. The whole place was just unprofessional. Like they were just there to hand out narcotic's. I will agree Dr Kahn's assistant was very nice. However my sister continued to see Dr. Kahn for 3 more months. She passed away in Sept. of an overdose. She was talking, Narco, Ambien, and a Muscle Relaxer, all of witch she got from Dr. Kahn. I'm not saying her death is his fault. I just think that Doctors that give that much meds. should be more responsible.  ",-1

2412,36018,1.0," I have seen Dr Kahn for years only because of cost. Would not reccomend him to anyone if you are want professional medical Exam.  He sees you for 2 minutes when he signs the scripts and thats it! His male assistant is great! Office staff is rude, inconsiderate and lazy. They never follow thru on referrals,messages, etc. Also, expect to be waiting for HOURS before being seen for a few minutes, basicly to just write your prescriptions! I realize drs get behind etc but you sit there and wait for hours while the staff goofs off , entire staff eats lunch at same time and they schedule patients at this time also, so you wait while they eat lunch for 30-60 mins. Dr has been under some type of investigation so all records are missing from patients charts! Sounds shady.  ",-1

2426,36040,1.0, Did not solve problem I went to him about.  Still have the problem ,-1
2427,36042,1.0," Although he is supposedly a reproductive endocronoligist he doesn't really help with fertility problems -- at least not in my case.  He callously told me I had a less than 2% chance of conceiving again (at age 39) and that I needed to just be thankful for the son I had and &quot;get over it.&quot;  Refused to run additional tests, or provide any type of fertility treatment.  I was devastated and cannot explain the months of crying and depression that I experienced.  And wouldn't you know it&#63;  One year later I was pregnant, on my own, without any intervention.  When I went in for my first appointment he told me &quot;well, don't count on really having a baby, at your age, you are likely to miscarriage.&quot;  Then, went on to tell me about all the &quot;hundreds&quot; of women he has seen in their late 30's and early 40's who had &quot;severely retarded&quot; children.  After being his patient for 7 years, I left.   Who needs that kind of treatment&#63; ",-1
2428,36042,1.0," I have been going to Dr L since 1984.  He is a very compassionate, caring man.  Without his help I would have never been able to have my 2 children.The same staff has been with him for all these years. They are all awesome and very punctual. ",1
2429,36042,1.0," His callous treatment still hurts me.  I was 32, and unknowingly had Hashimoto's Hypothyroiditis, (low thyroid symptoms),went to this ob/endocrinologist for help. W/o testing my blood he told me after repeated visits I was going to die of a &quot;dreaded disease&quot; or needed a psychiatrist for severe depression, the latter which is what he strongly recommended.  Worst part, He let me go so long without proper treatment I was very ill  with an enlarged heart by the time I reached proper medical care.  When I got well I returned to inform him of his mistake, and he called me a liar and would not believe me until he  got the other Dr.'s records.  He never apologized. ",-1
2430,36042,1.0," I had thrombophlebitis two weeks after the birth of my second child, the second child delivered by Dr. Lackritz. When I phoned Dr. Lackritz to tell him I could not walk on the one leg and had heat and swelling, his reponse was that &quot;all women feel bad after childbirth.&quot; I was later that day admitted to the hospital by my godfather, a rheumatologist. Dr. Lackritz also came to the delivery room so exhausted he cut my child's cord on the wrong side of the clamp, necessitating a stay for her in the Infant ICU.  ",-1

2433,36053,1.0, I was so pleased to find Dr Lackan.  His entire staff was wonderful at my first visit and has continued to be so throughout every office appointment.  He is very patient with me and has explained things to me very well.  I had a thyroid biopsy.  I was so scared but it was less discomfort than getting a flu shot.  He is wonderful and I would highly recommend him.  ,1
2434,36053,1.0," I saw Dr. Laken for 5 yrs ,saw him personally 2 times. His Nurse reminds me of Nurse Ratchet. Not very nice and always blames you for not taking meds but when it takes them 3 to 5 days to call your Pharmacy not really your fault.Also to talk to someone in the office is like talking to the cable TV people, FOREVER .If you want a one on one Dr, he is too busy for that and if you cancel your appointment you are looking at waiting 60 to 90 days to get back in, what a joke.. HE is nice when you see him you are such a number there , not a personal relationship at all.  ",-1
2435,36053,1.0," Dr. Lacken has not been helpful in addressing my thyroid condition.  While he listens attentively, he seems bewildered and lacks up to date information.  He does not offer helpful suggestions to support my overall condition. While he recommends tests, staff fail to follow through with processing doctors orders.  Patients must call and prompt follow through with doctor recommended testing referrals. Not helpful at all. ",-1
2436,36053,1.0," I went to Dr. Lachan because he was highly recommended on this sight, but it has been a disappointment.  I've gone for two years with few answers and no improvement in help...and I've done everything requested. Every complaint listed below is totally true.  I am on my way to his office to have my records sent somewhere else...and sign the release form again...they keep &quot;losing&quot; it...if you care about your health, don't go here.  ",-1
2437,36053,1.0," When I first started seeing Dr. Lackan, he and his staff were very attentive.  Now it is less and less.  It has taken three weeks to get a phone call back in regards to my blood work only to find out the wrong one was done.  Feel like the older patients are being put on the back burner.  Too many new patients and back logged.  ",-1
2438,36053,1.0," This doctor is not open to all treatment options. He will omit offering patients a save and affordable treatment plan. He lacks up to date knowledge on recent indications and medical warnings. He is polite and a great person, but I wouldn't send any family member to a specialist that is unaware of the newest information. ",-1
2439,36053,1.0," Unbelievable!! My 83 yr. old mother has been waiting over a month to see Lackan. When we got there we were told she had an appt. with another Dr. and never had an appt. with Lackan and he was out sick, anyway. My mother wanted to go ahead with other Dr. but then was told she would have to stay with this doctor and could never see Lackan. Truly as bad as it gets. We walked out and he will get a bill from me for my time. ",-1
2440,36053,1.0, I went to this doctor for over a year before I ever saw him.  I saw a medical assistant....after almost demanding to see a REAL doctor he granted me this request.....  I am activly looking for a real doctor.  This was the first and last time I saw a doctor.  Diabetes is a serious illness and seeing a nurse on every occasion is scary for me. You pay the same with or without the &quot;doctor&quot;...so why not see the person who is &quot;trained&quot; to serve you.  Would NOT recommend this facility at all. ,-1
2441,36053,1.0," This doctor needs to get his staff inline or more patients will be leaving him. Excuses and lies the office staff has continued to use. As for as a doctor who knows only seen him once of a 4 year period of going to his office, always with assistant never him. Maybe once you are called a top doctor no need to continue that way.  well doctor lackan you lost me as patient ",-1
2442,36053,1.0," Dr. Lackan is a very knowledgeable and concerned about your health.  I have been battling a thyroid problem for over 4 years, and have been through 2 doctors that just wanted to increase my medication or put me on anti-depressants rather than really investigate and fix the problem.  That has not been the case with Dr. Lackan.  He asked questions, and then listened to everything that I had to say.  He took everything into account and ran several tests before discussing my options with me.  He has been a life saver.  ",1
2443,36053,1.0," Very good staff,very knowledgeable, on time. Just good quality service at everything.  ",1
2444,36053,1.0, Dr. Lacklan seriously rocks.. Never rushed.. very thorough.. he makes sure you understand everything before leaving.. they make you have your blood drawn first then you make an appt.. that way the Dr has the results of your tests while you are there and you can go over the results together.. I am telling you.. he is one of the best doctors I have ever been lucky enough to have.. His staff is just as wonderful as he is.. and even though this doesn't matter.. his office is just gorgeous.. ,1
2445,36053,1.0," Dr. Lacken is great. I would recommend anyone to him. When you first walk through the door your greeted by the most friendly staff. I have quite seeing a doctor because of the lady at the front. Anyways, then you get called back by one of the nurses. They are just as concerned with your health as the doctor. Lab work, radiation treatment, and even sonograms are done right in his office. Every time I went in he explained exactly what we where going to do in the next step of my treatment. I even called him two or three times and he got right back with me. I am very glad that someone recommended me to him. ",1
2446,36053,1.0, I have a complicated health problem and Dr. Lackan was very understanding and listened to every word I said. It was very nice since the bzillion other doctors I tried were not willing to listen and offered unhelpful advice. He knew exactly what to do.  ,1
2447,36056,1.0," Dr. Ladd is very personable, uses new technology, has a beautiful, welcoming office and great staff.  I encourage all my friends and family to go to Dr. Ladd!  He has treated me for pre-cancerous spots, his staff has performed laser surgery on my face to remove pre-cancerous spots and with each visit I am treated professionally and personally.  I highly recommend AustinSkin.  ",1
2448,36056,1.0," Dr. Ladd was really nice, fairly punctual, and seemed like he knew his stuff. He was easy to talk to. He seemed to really try to understand my needs and offer me the full range of options for treatment.  ",1
2449,36058,1.0," I saw multiple doctors in my home state of California (all certified and claiming to be affiliated with one professional sports team or another).  They could repair my biceps tear, but recovery would be 6 weeks in a sling followed by months of rehabilitation.  Dr. Labbe saw me within a week, and was able to repair my injury with advanced techniques, allowing me to return to full range of motion within two weeks.  I can not begin to thank him and his staff for the care they have provided me and my family.  ",1
2450,36065,1.0," Dr. Labor listened to what I needed, wanted, and expected; he didn't waste any time with too much information.  ",1
2451,36065,1.0, Very good Dr. no problems from surgery in over one year.  ,1
2452,36065,1.0, Office staff is very unorganized and did not communicate properly. ,1
2453,36068,1.0," We are going to miss him.  Our insurance is changing so we can't keep him.  He is never on time, but well worth the wait.  ",1
2454,36068,1.0, He is an absolutely fantastic Dr!  I drive an hour just to keep him as our pediatrician.  We have been using him since he first came to TX Children's at Cypress Station.  I always refer my friends and family to him.  ,1
2455,36068,1.0, I love Dr. LaCour. He is very patient and my kid loves him too. I have a friend whose kid had a very rare condition and Dr. LaCour referred him to a specialist immediately.  Good Doctor! ,1
2456,36068,1.0, I have an autisic son and Dr. La Cour has always been So friendly and knowledgable in dealing w/him. He has a wonderful manner and very compassionate staff. My family couldn't recommend any doctor any higher for their child w/ special needs. ,1
2457,36068,1.0," Dr. LaCour is absolutely FABULOUS!  I would be heartbroken if he ever left pediatrics. He takes the time to answer all of your questions, and also will call and check up on your sick child after-hours.  He's great! He really has a way with children and makes them feel so comfortable with his awesome personality.  My children adore him, and he makes going to the doctor enjoyable. We lucked out when we got him for a doctor.  =) ",1
2458,36068,1.0," Dr. LaCour is absolutely fabulous!! He is super personable and helpful. He is not afraid to look to outside help. In fact, when a very dear friend of mine had a very sick child, he got him in at Texas Children's right away. My children love him. He checks up on them after hours. You can tell he loves what he does and is very good at it.  ",1
2459,36068,1.0," Great doctor for colds and the common illness, however, if your child might have a special problem, atypical infections, or the like, this is not the doctor for you. Very slow to get help from other speacialists and does not follow through with what he says he will do. Very slow to admit to hospital to the point of dehydration. great personality, great for commmon illness, but anything else, and I would recommend a different doctor. ",-1
2460,36070,2.0," Great Doctor, very professional,educated, and thorough, friendly staff.   Will definitely recommend ",1
2461,36075,2.0, Friendly and willing to spend time with to acess the problem..Keeps up with your history.  ,1
2462,36076,1.0, Dr Lacey is absolutely awesome. he takes his time with my kids and talks to them like they are intelligent grown people. very respectful of them and me. his staff is really great. then again Baylor wouldn't put up with rude staff. as a healthcare worker i know when my kids are given the treatment they need not all the unnecessary tests and he only does what is needed. he may suggest other procedures but lets you know they are optional.  ,1
2463,36079,1.0,.  Overbearing and argumentative in outpatient setting ,-1
2464,36079,1.0, Told me one thing from tests I had years before then after tests this time tells me the total opposite.  I don't think he knows what he is doing.  ,-1
2465,36079,1.0, most uncaring doctor on the planet. told us to go home and wait for death. did not want to refer to anyone else what a tool ,-1
2466,36079,1.0, Dr Lacey is very knowledgable. Took time with me and explained things in detail. Listens to your concerns and answer all questions. I was very pleased with him and the staff in the Keller office.  ,1
2467,36082,0.0, In talking she was able to detect my weekness and help me understand my sadness. Dr. Ladd is very intuitive to people.  Assisting me in the right direction to help my depression.  ,1
2468,36084,1.0, Dr. Laborde is one of the best doctors I've ever encountered.  His bedside manner is exceptional.  He is friendly and knowledgeable and make his patients feel at ease.  ,1
2469,36084,1.0, Dr. Laborde is excellent.  He is very thorough and takes the time to explain things in a thoughtful manner.  ,1
2470,36084,1.0,.   ,-1
2471,36084,1.0," Dr. Van Laborde is one of Houston's Top Docs and is one of few peer-reviewed doctors. Not cheap, but when it comes to your face, you don't want amateurs. He's worth every penny.  ",1
2472,36102,1.0, Horrible service and did not seem to care about my concerns. Felt that they were trying to sell me products that I did not need and the wait was almost an hour. Would not recommend to anybody. Avoid this dentist.  ,-1
2473,36102,1.0, I went in to get my teeth checked and he said I should just have them all pulled and have these new fancy &quot;expensive&quot; teeth put in.   And that lady at the front desk was just down right rude! ,-1
2474,36102,1.0, NOT A FRIENDLY OFFICE AND SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU FIND SOMEBODY ELSE TO GET YOUR DENTAL WORK DONE AT! ,-1
2475,36104,2.0,  ,1
2476,36110,0.0," While I liked Dr. Lacy's caring &amp; outgoing bedside manner, she never effectively treated or determined the cause of my painful menstrual issues.  Then when I resumed going back to her practice in 03 I was assigned to her NP Deedee &amp; was less than thrilled w/her.  She was alright at 1st but wasn't open to giving me good options &amp; said I had anxiety &amp; needed to be on anti-anxiety meds for my fast heartrate.  Lo &amp; behold a few years later I was diagnosed w/thyroid disease &amp; a arrhythmia by another OB/GYN &amp; sent to a cardiologist that said this is what was the likely cause of my menstrual issues &amp; irregular heart rate.  In all fairness, Dr. Lacy delivered my sister's son &amp; w/a happy healthy outcome.  However, I found her NP Deedee's hasty diagnosis, tactless &amp; inept. ",1
2477,36112,2.0," Great Doctor , very caring answered all my Questions. The staff was great and very helpful. ",1
2478,36115,0.0," Dr. Lackan-McKenzie is wonderful!!! I love the way she takes care of my children. She is very thorough, and doesn’t assume or leave anything up to chance, and this gives me peace of mind. She takes the time to spend with us and make sure we are comfortable all our questions are answered. Because she did this I didn’t mind waiting, but the wait time has actually gone down the past couple of times we’ve been in.   I have always been able to get an appointment the same day I called. My children absolutely LOVE her and her nurses.   We love you Dr. Lackan, you are such a blessing to our family.  ",1
2479,36115,0.0," I love Dr. Lackan!! Dr. Lackan is a Dr. that cares about her patients. Not only does she care but she is knowlagable, and she takes the time. I have had to wait, but I know she is helping someone else and will give me the time I need to help me understand what is going on with my children. A Dr. that you can trust and know's what she is doing is priceless!! I owe many thanks to Dr. Lackan for the help she has given our family over the years.  ",1
2480,36118,1.0, LOVE Dr. Mabli!! Very insightful! My husband loves him as well. Makes you look at things differently. Just a wonderful counselor and man! ,1
2481,36118,1.0," I'm a 23 year old woman suffering from severe depression and anxiety. Dr. Mabli is fantastic! I've been struggling with anxiety all my life and I have seen many psychiatrists, but he's the only one who has ever really helped. He’s a little tough on you and does want you to challenge yourself, but also gives coping techniques. I really cannot say enough about how much this man has done for me. I can go to the grocery store, the movies, and family gatherings. I’m back in school and working full time. I didn’t think it was possible.  ",1
2482,36123,1.0," The best doctor in Southeast Texas, for sure. I see other people have said it, but it's true that he really cares. ",1
2483,36123,1.0, Dr. Mabray is encouraging and experiences. He explains things better than any doctor I have ever visited.  He specializes in allergies and bariactrics also.   I recommend him to everyone I like! ,1
2484,36123,1.0," I've been going to Dr. M for 30 yrs. He is the most knowledgeable Dr. I know. I miscarried once, he saved my next. he is not your everyday conventional Dr. He has a yearning for learning and growing in his medical education. He cares for and takes time with each patient. Everything he has ever taught me about has come to pass over the years concerning my health.                            Mary ",1
2485,36123,1.0, I've been a patient of Dr. Mabray for 22 years.  He is caring and emphasizes preventative care.  He listens and evaluates carefully; he takes small patient observations seriously.  His staff is caring and competent.  I would and have recommended Dr. Mabray many times.   Sharon Smith ,1
2486,36123,1.0," Dr. Mabray was recommended to me by a friend. I drove a far distance to Victoria, Texas, to see him and was thoroughly pleased. He so obviously cared about me as a patient and really listened. He really seemed to want to help me feel better. I would recommend him to my family and friends in a heartbeat. Excellent physician! ",1
2487,36129,1.0, Dr. Maccatto and his staff have provided me with outstanding care and service. He's delivered two of my babies and I've always felt he was more than knowledgeable and prepared to deal with any situation. I've really liked his staff.  I've almost always been surprised at how fast they get me in and out of the office.  I highly recommend Dr. Maccatto.  ,1
2488,36129,1.0," Dr.  Maccato is the best!! He delivered my two girls and I absoultly LOVE HIM!! He is kind, very patient, and has the best assistants in the world! If I have any more kids I will run straight back to him GREAT DOCTOR! ",1

2490,36129,1.0," He's very down to earth and comforting. He's also funny and easy going. He took me in as a patient when no other doctor would, because most doctors care about lawsuits more than the actual person/patient. I am so glad Dr.Maccato accepted me.  He's great! ",1
2491,36129,1.0, This is the best doctor I've ever encountered. I wish he could serve as a doctor in other capacities as well. He's so comforting. I highly recommend him.  He delivered 3 of my 5 children! ,1

2496,36129,1.0, The BEST!  I have just moved out of state and I wish I could have taken him with us to deliver our second child.  Never have to wait long at his office.

2502,36135,1.0, I am in greater pain than before my surgery. 1yr post op and still unable to work from a routine surgery. He doesn't manage pain even while in hospital. He doesn't see patients after surgery but let's a med student release them from hospital. And when you call in staff doesnt return calls. He will not call you back even with a personal promise to do so.He relies on the opinion of his nurse practitioner too much. He doesn't asses the patient himself. ,-1
2503,36135,1.0," I had a bulging disc in L5/S1 pressing on my sciatic nerve in 2003.  I lived with it for 6 months, tried chiropractic for months, until he ordered an MRI and we saw the problem.  He sent me to Dr. Macdougall - surgery was my only option, except live with it (I'm a diabetic and could not do cortisone injections).  He was able to get me in for surgery within a couple of weeks and I was immediately pain free.  He is a very nice man, knowledgeable, listens to his patients.  Did not order any more needless tests.  I think he's the best.  Now I live in Odessa again and need more surgery on the same disc.  I would really like to go back to him, but it's a little inconvenient since I'm so far away.  ",1
2504,36135,1.0, I believe this neurosurgeon is one of the best in the Houston area.  He is personable and spends the time needed to help you understand your issues.  He allowed me to participate in making the decisions regarding treatment options best directed at my problem.  ,1
2505,36135,1.0," I read the review on thois docotr from 1/09 someone else had put in.  I fully disagree.  This person likely was disgruntled, as the docotr is excellent.  He spends time with you, treats you like an individual, and he is an excellent surgeon.  His reputation in the Baytown and Houston community is excellent.  When a neurosurgical issue is mentioned, even among any person in our community, his name comes up as among the best of the best.  ",1
2506,36135,1.0, Poor Attitude from the doctor ,-1
2507,36135,1.0," I felt very well treated and listened to. Additionally, this doctor seemed very skilled to recognize things others, who had treated me, had not. He pinpointed the problem very rapidly. I wished I had gone here first. ",1

2510,36139,1.0," My spouse and I both switched to &quot;Dr. Mac&quot; several months ago. It was one of the best decisions we ever made. His office staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and he is personable and intelligent.  You pay an annual fee to be a member of his practice, but then you never pay a copay for an office visit after that. He will run all labs through insurance and work with you to find appropriate specialists as needed.  For the first time in my life, I feel as if a doctor truly cares about me and my family and has the actual time to give us the kind of care we need.  ",1
2511,36139,1.0," thorough, excellent diagnostic skills with a humorous, caring bedside manner.He sees my whole family and have recommended him to a large number of friends and family. I am glad that I changed from my previous doctor to Dr. MacGillivray as the difference it made to my health and wellness is immeasurable.I have come to trust him implicitly as my physician, but he always insists that participate and ultimately decide the course of my healthcare. I simply cannot recommend Dr. MacGillivray enough to all people who care about their healthcare. He changed my life. ",1
2512,36153,2.0, Good Dr but never on time for appointments. Often you have to wait about an hour or more. ,1
2513,36154,0.0," I recently switched doctors at 25 weeks pregnant because this office is so horrible.  The front office staff is the worst I've ever experienced.  One nurse, Dee is nice but I would DREAD getting the other nurse.  I made it my goal to get that one to smile-it never worked.  Dr. Motta is okay, but after they tried to schedule my induction at 9 WEEKS I got nervous &amp; read all the reviews about how so many people had been lied to or manipulated into getting induced.  I left immediately &amp; found a fabulous Dr. (Hoffman) who I am so happy with!! ",-1
2514,36154,0.0," Front staff is extremely rude and not helpful at all. The phones can ring for over 10 minutes, then you are placed on hold for over 20 minutes (i took the time). After the long wait, the staff treats you like they are doiong you a favor and you should go out of your way to please them! Do not recommend this place at all. See a different office where the staff actually understands customer service and wants to be part of the service indsutry.  Very unpleasant experience ",-1
2515,36154,0.0," She told me at my 36wk sono that my baby is humongous &amp; I cant deliver vaginally, baby weighed 6 lbs 4oz. She insisted that I schedule Csection immediately as there was no other way.I asked her to give me some time to think about it. But she was not ready to discuss it &amp; made me schedule csection at 39wk. She did mentioned that she is on vacation for a week (where my due date fell) I seeked second opinion from couple of other OB/GYNs &amp; was told that sonos later in pregnancy r not accurate &amp; there is no need to schedule csection, I could try a normal labor &amp; if things dont progress well then I may have to go for a csection. I went for next appointment hoping to talk this through with her but she didnt want any discussion &amp; she started enacting how my baby would look if she had shoulder dislocation during delivery etc which was very unprofessional. I lost my trust in her completely &amp; we switched doctors such late in the pregnancy. Our daughter was born vaginally &amp; weighed only 7.5lbs.  ",-1
2516,36154,0.0," Dr. Mace-Motta's license should be taken away!! The staff nurses are rude, cold and very uncaring. Simply awful! She wanted to treat my irregular periods with birth control pills. I suffer from severe migraines and cannot take them I told her. Oh they are a different formula! NOT!! I could have died!! Side effects from taking it are heart attack, stroke, heart failure!!! This is not, &quot;oh, you will just get a headache if you take these pills.&quot; YOU WILL DIE!! DO NOT GO TO DR. MACE-MOTTA! In addition, she rambles on about her vast knowledge, but she didn't even read the latest report saying people with migraines should NOT take birth control pills! She won't even discuss problems with you. She relies on the examination doc. (I was also diagnosed with a lump in my breast. Thank you G'd for it turned out to be a large cyst.  DO NOT GO TO HER! NO PATIENT SHOULD BE TREATED THE WAY I WAS TREATED BY HER &amp; HER STAFF! ",-1
2517,36154,0.0," I was diagnosed with placenta previa and went to see a specialist because I was concerned. She never discussed the results of the sonogram with me: she left that up to the sono tech. When the results from the specialist were sent to her office, she became angry, demanding to know why I had seen a specialist. Does not allow doulas, does not return calls.  ",-1
2518,36154,0.0," This is by FAR the WORST ob-gyn I have ever had to deal with,beginning with her less-than-stellar office nurse Dee,she was a TOTAL bi*&%! I was going in for a hysterectomy- a very vulnerable time in a woman's life which was bad enough, when I was in her office waiting for her, the above mentioned Dee &quot;lost&quot; my paperwork for short-term disability-5 minutes after I gave it to her in her hand! The &quot;doctor&quot; then yelled at me when I started to cry-I was going to have a damned hysterectomy and all she could do was yell. People get ANOTHER MD and avoid this mess at any cost,by the way you can read all her reviews online,there are NONE that are good.  ",-1
2519,36154,0.0, BAIT AND SWITCH  Scheduled an appointment and did not even get to meet the doctor; was only allowed to see Nurse Practitioner. Make sure you clarify ten times who you will see and what kind of appointment you're scheduled for!! They have very poor communication with this area and will charge you even if it's not the right kind of appointment you requested. ,-1
2520,36156,0.0, We love Dr. Maaytah and the whole staff is great with both of my kids. We are always in and out of their in a timely manner.  ,1
2521,36156,0.0, I have the opportunity to see most of the Amarillo pediatricians and see their manner outside of patient care. She is always very professional and polite.  I trust her opinions and would reccommend her to anyone!! ,1
2522,36156,0.0," Dr. Maaytah has been my children's (I have 3) pediatrician for the past 15 years. I've been to her office countless times over the years and I can honestly say that it is always a pleasant experience. I know that some days we've been in there have been hectic, especially in the winter, but Dr. Maaytah makes me feel as though I'm the only patient there, she spends her time and does not rush at all. One thing I especially like about Dr. Maaytah is that she doesn't make you feel as though the questions you are asking are stupid, as some other doctors do. There's room for improvement with the staff, but Dr. Maaytah's care makes up for any shortcomings in her staff. ",1

2524,36156,0.0, I love Dr. Maaytah.  I think she is the best pediatrician in town.  I wish her staff was more friendly and helpful. I feel like they don't ever want you to bring your child in and always try to give advice over the phone without seeing my child. I still wouldn't take my child anywhere else.  Maaytah is the best! ,1

2527,36156,0.0," Have a 2 yr. old.  Been going to Dr. Maaytah since she was born.  Really enjoy her.  On the other hand, I would have to say that her staff is HORRIBLE.  They are extremely rude any time I call or go in the office.  Numerous times they have cut me off and said that a nurse will call me back which always takes 30 minutes to sevearal hours.  It seems like when I do get a call back staff does what they can to not have to make an appointment.  I always have to be push to get my child in.  So overall, I do love Dr. Maaytah but her staff makes it hard to continue using her at times.  ",1

2529,36156,0.0," Dr. Maaytah is very helpful and very nice.  She takes time to listen to what you have to say and she does a full assessment of the patient.  I am very happy with her.  The business office staff is not kind.  A smile goes a long way.  It is not often that you find a doctor that you like and staff that you don't like, but she will continue to see my children anyway.

He knows his stuff and doesn't bother with a bunch of nonsense.  Staff was very nice and courteous.  They're very good with booking same-day appointments if you really need to get in right away.  We were pleased with the care we received.  ",1

2537,36166,0.0," I recently had my first child with Dr. Mace-Motta and the entire experience was perfect in every way. From the regular OB visits to the daily visits in the hospital, Dr. Motta was warm and professional (and always prompt at appointments). Her office staff is also very friendly and helpful - no questions are silly and they made me feel at ease from the very first day. My husband and I had a great experience and we cannot imagine having any better physician than Dr. Motta.  ",1
2538,36166,0.0," I have found Dr. Motta's staff refreshingly professional, pleasant and knowledgeable and Dr. Motta has a wonderful bedside manner. She welcomes questions and does not make patients feel intimidated. My experiences have always exceeded expecations and the professionalism, courtesy and punctuality that her office shows patients reflects the respect she seems to have for us. I would highly recommend Dr. Motta to friends and was referred by a colleague in the healthcare industry.  ",1
2539,36166,0.0," *******VERY IMPORTANT******** Do not go this doctor. This doctor, by default, eventually will perform C-Section. Till the very last moment she will say that everything is fine. And on the day of delivery she will break the water way before the contraction will start and give some reason to perform C-Section. In our case, she said there is hand presentation/baby in awkward position. We have heard some similar things from a few other patients.  ",-1
2540,36167,0.0, Excellent dentist!  He is our family dentist as of 1/2010.  He filled my 9 yr. old daughters cavity today and he talked her through the process and kept her calm and happy.  Thank you Dr. Mabry! ,1

2542,36170,1.0," Dr. Mabrey is the most caring and skilled Surgeon, I ever met! No wonder, he is the Chief of Orthopedic Surgeons at Baylor. My Hip Surgery was very complex and challenging... significant Pelvis-socket erosion had occurred from having multiple, total Hip Joints for over 37 years! Can you find reliable info on the net&#63; You Bet! Thank God, I found ratemds... that's why I chose Dr. Mabrey! He listens intently to his patients... it really is all about you! He does not have pre-prepared speeches. He has a warm, comforting sense of humor about the difficult procedure. Dr. Mabrey used all sorts of specialized mechanical components, to make a perfect fitting joint. After the fourth, most traumatic, Left Hip operation ever... I've never felt better, and my legs are perfectly balanced! Thanks to all the prior responders, for their honest and accurate reviews. Dr.  Mabrey is a Saint, sent down from heaven, or more accurately; a god on earth, who puts us back together! GR in Shady Shores, Texas ",1
2543,36170,1.0," I have been with Dr. Mabrey since he was in San Antonio, Texas, at the University of Texas Health Center. He has performed two hip replacements on me. My hip problem was so bad that other doctors would not perform any kind of surgey on me. They said that I would need to see Dr. Mabrey. He would be the only one that could fix the hip. I go once a year to see Dr. Mabrey. It is a 5 hr. drive for me one way. Even if Dr. Mabrey moved out of the state of Texas, I would make the trip to his office. You stay with a doctor that you trust. And I do trust him.  ",1
2544,36170,1.0," Dr. Mabrey is brilliant, funny, attentive, caring and the best doctor around. I would recommend my mother to him.  A+++++ ",1
2545,36170,1.0," Probably the best doctor I've ever seen.  He LISTENS, and knows what he's doing.  He diagnosed my problem quickly, but was not pushy.  He performed my hip replacement surgery, I had good results and I would recommend him to anyone.  ",1
2546,36170,1.0," I felt totally at ease after my first visit with Dr. Mabrey.  He was very informative, yet left the decision on what treatment I want for the osterarthritis in my hip totally up to me.  I chose a thp and my surgery went well.  My incision looks great.  I feel that Dr. Mabrey takes interest in each patient and truly wants to help them.  He is very experienced and knowledgeabe.  His staff is very kind, helpful, and accomodating.  ",1
2547,36170,1.0," Wonderful surgeon.  Diagnosed me right away, confirmed it with MRI, operated, and I was good to go.  Would use again and would recommend.  Office is not great looking, but that doesnt matter. His main nurse Kathy is really helpful and patient also. ",1
2548,36174,1.0, Always a wait at the office. Each time well over an hour with zero apology.  Dr. Machell upon there being a diagnosed problem is quick to answer &quot;I don't know&quot; and not provide reassurance.  After an ablation with him I experienced immediate PVC beats which have turned into PVC to VT.  These serious rhythm problems never existed until after the surgery.  I was assured that the beats would cease over time by Dr. Machell only they have become more frequent and worse.  I have left the Practice and will only see the Experienced and knowledgable EP Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic.  I am fairly young and have young children; the experience with Dr. Machell has changed my life for the worse.  I look forward to never stepping foot into that office again and trying to get my life and heart health back. ,-1
2549,36174,1.0," Dr. Machell did the heart ablation for my wife.  He was the second referral my wife had seen.  He was much more confident that the first Electro-Physiologist. He quickly located the errant signals and performed the ablations, fixing my wife's tacycardia. His office is prompt in seeing patients. He gave me good explanation before and after the procedure.  He came highly recommended by my wife's cardiologists. ",1
2550,36175,1.0," When I described my new symptoms he seemed confused. He told me he did not see anything visually or under the microscope and the results would be in about 2 days. After 2 days no one called or returned my messages, I went back to the office, where the front office girl gave me my results HIPAA violation. He only gave me a prescription after I asked for one. Now I have to spend more money to find a new physician who can take time out of their busy schedule to care about my health. ",-1

2555,36182,0.0," The first time I met him he was informative and helpful, while scheduling a colnoscopy. Then at the hospital we discovered he'd triple booked patients for the same time. The nurse working there agreed that he shouldn't have done this and recommended her GI Dr to me for the future. So I was already really nervous and then was forced to wait over 2.5 hours while he did the other 2 patients. (Even though I was on time.) I've had a bad history of waking up vomiting after procedures with anesthesia, yet he was just listening to his music and not reassuring at all. At the follow up appointment after waiting 30 minutes to be seen, he was in and out in 2 minutes- did not want to answer questions and I felt like I had to pry information out of him about my disorder. Felt so rushed and like I was interfering with his time. I do not think he cares about his patients one bit. Definitely a disappointment and a doctor I will not return to or recommend.  ",-1
2556,36182,0.0, i thought Dr. Maat was fabulous.  He has a great bedside manner and is very knowledgeable.  He is empathetic and really is interested in my health.  ,1

2560,36188,1.0, An excellent physician/surgeon with a terrible &quot;chair-side&quot; manner.  I nthe operating room he is in his territory but in a one on one situation he is not very talkative.

2569,36210,0.0," Service is fine unless you need paper work filled out. Staff does not follow up with their patients so you are left playing phone tag and paper chasing during your spare time. Staff seems not to communicate with each other very well. You will have multiple staff memebers contacting you with different information. Staff seems to be fresh out of &quot;techincal school&quot; and need a refresher course in Customer Service.  Very poor service, I will never go back! ",-1

During my pregnancy we encountered a couple of issues, it was quite a relief to experience the extra mile and care Dr. Udell took to calm my nerves; then take care of what was going on.  If youre in search of a doctor that is in a group of doctors, has a lavishly decorated office this is not the place for you.  But if you are in search of a small yet personal and professional experience,  our family HIGHLY reccommends Dr. Udell.  Without a doubt she is the best kept secret in Arlington, TX.  ",1

When I called to say the creme wasn't helping, I was told to switch to an otc cortisone creme. I finally went to a dermatologist to figure out what was wrong. He was astonished that she was unable to diagnose me correctly, as it took him seconds to see the problem. When I called to tell the nurse what happened she was rude and sarcastic.  Don't go to this doctor!!!! ",-1

His office staff has always been quite nice and that &quot; rude French lady&quot; has been nothing short of lovely to both me and my husband.

The clinic will not give me my prescription, nor will they sell me any lenses. The clinic claims that by not coming back within 30 days, I lost my ability to get new lenses or a copy of my presription. Nowhere on the form I signed does it say that if I don't come back that I lose my right to my prescription. No one at the clinic stated that if I didn't come to a follow up appointment that I would lose my prescription. If their form said anything about losing my right to fill a prescription, I would have made a return visit. Their form states their return policy for unhappy clients only.

It was one of the most horrible experiences I have ever had with a doctor and his arrogance appalled me.  I told him the whole week I was in the hospital it was an abcess, but he chose to ignore me.  I have told as many people as I can to stay away from him and I will continue until he retires.   He needs to be disbarred! ",-1

He was recommended by the family practioner we had at the time.  ,1

2608,36229,1.0,I rated Dr. Uddin on him he is GREAT. It's the new Dr. (Dr. Cooper) he has there now that is the problem. She isn't very helpful when you ask question and she contradicted herself several times. When I would try to get a clarification she seemed irritated. (This is after she prescribed my toddler a high dose of medicine that has us at the ER previously) If you make your appt. for fist thing in the morning you get right in anytime after 11 you will have a long wait.

The office staff is very rude  and not helpful or caring... the doctors do not care and are not helpful or very knowledgeable.  A friend of mines child was hospitalized and now lives everyday with a problems that could have been prevented if the doctors took their time and paid attention to him I am in the process of changing doctors now and would never go back.. I have tried to vioce my concern to them  and nothing has changed. I tried to wait  and see if it would get better b/c my kids have gone there so long but it hasn't!

When my mother complained about having problems digesting food, Dr. Uppal told her she had acid reflux and prescribed yet more medications. If she would have done her job, Dr. Uppal would have performed diagnostic testing and found out that my mother had stomach cancer. By the time my mother went to an orthopedic doctor for what she thought was a broken arm, she found out that the stomach cancer had spread to her bones and liver and 2 months later she was dead. Please save your own life and DO NOT go to Dr. Uppal! ",-1

2615,36232,1.0,"Dr. Ubaldo is extremely arrogant and doesnt care how he treats his staff or his patients.  Today, I heard him yelling at someone on the phone.  The last person that rated this Doctor must have mistaken someone else for his Office Manager.  The Office Manager was the only good thing about this office.  He was there a very short time but made a huge difference.  Everytime the Doctor made a mistake the Office Manager took care of it immediately and then called me the next day to make sure everything was OK.  He would check on the time you spent waiting and try to move you in to see the Doctor asap.  The Doctor was the hold up.  You dont find an Office Manager in a Clinic like that anymore.  Believe me, this Doctor makes a lot of mistakes.  I found out today his Office Manager resigned. He was the only reason I stayed with Dr. Ubaldo the last couple of months; he cared. PEOPLE, you will regret it if you go to this Doctor now.  Dont do it.  There are plenty of good doctors around Katy.  ",-1
2616,36232,1.0,"There isn't much communication about what is going on.There is no follow up. It's hard to get an appointment even if you are really sick.They do call with test results but always say..the dr. said everything was &quot;normal&quot; I have to go in and get a copy printed out so I can actually see what my &quot;normal&quot;test results are ,and it's a big hassle to get a printout when they should have one ready in my file. He has taken in too much of a patient load. His office manager was really snotty to me for NO reason.OMG there are so many other Dr.'s to try so I don't have to deal with all that anymore. When he first started that office it was SO much better.It was what a good office is supposed to be.  HOWEVER, I will say that he always correctly diagnosed my illnesses and gave me the correct medication to treat the symptoms. It's a shame about all the rest. ",-1

2618,36232,1.0,"After you have made an appointment and taken the time off work. Even after sitting in his office for hours, you take a chance of being rudely told by his receptionist that the Dr. had an emergency and had to leave. When you do get the chance to be seen after hours of waiting of course, he rushes into the room and signs whatever prescriptions his nurses already wrote out and then leaves. He doesn't say more than &quot;hello&quot;. Very uncaring. Just looking for more money from your pocket. Not to mention the cursing and yelling he does to his nurses. Very hostile environment! ",-1

2621,36232,1.0,"Dr. Ubaldo is extremely rude.  He has no problem prescribing drugs that will get you addicted and then cut you off at any time he wants. I was on a medicine that required a visit every two months but he and his business mgr. would always find a reason for me to have to come in every month just so he could get his money. That is another story, some people get charged $95, some $75 and some $40 depending on your income. The nurses are extremely rude and they will talk about your medical history and the reason you are there in front of other patients, which some of you might know is very illegal. This place seems to me to be nothing more than a so-called &quot;pill mill&quot;. Do not use this doctor. He did not even go to an American medical school. ",-1

2625,36232,1.0,"We followed another Dr. to this location. When she left they assigned another Dr. to us. When he left I got Dr. Ubaldo. Cold, unfriendly. Count on at least a 1-1/2 hour wait to get in, minimum. That's just for a blood test to keep getting your prescription. Nurses don't return phone calls to other clinics. I always had to get involved and call to find out why they wouldn't call. I am currently filling out forms to move my family elsewhere.  ",1
2626,36232,1.0,Great doctor! He cares and will always answer all of your questions you have even if he is very busy. If you have alot of questions you might want to write them down so that you don't forget when you get there.He is trusted and and respected by so many patients.  ,1
2627,36232,1.0,I have stopped going to this doctor and will not refer any of my friends or family members to him. He is quick to prescribe any kind of medicine to you or your family just to get you out of the office and on to the next patient. I made the mistake of taking my high school daughter there and he gave her Adderal for her trouble in focusing in school when all she needed was to have a little more guidance from him as to what was really wrong. He was quick to diagnosis problems that you really did not have. ,-1
2628,36232,1.0,I don't like this Doctor. I trusted him with my health and he began to flirt with me and ask me out. I felt very uncomfortable and have trouble trusting male Doctors because of him. I told him I had a lot of pain and he laughed at me as if I were joking. Women beware!! ,-1

Everyone stays loyal to him because he is so smart, yet kind and he listens!I would drive 100 miles just to see him, rather than change doctors, thank goodness he stays in Katy area. A doctor you can trust, plus he sends you to specialists if you need them. ",1

2646,36240,0.0,"PROBLEMATIC doctor.  I had to appeal her decision to code my routine office visit and related lab test as linked to a bone and cartilage disorder.  It was resulting in over $600 of bills at my expense when I have insurance to cover routine preventative visits and tests.  She based the decision on a very minimal result of oesteopenia which is not considered a bone disorder and is treatable by taking calcium + D.  She sees patients out of order when an appointment has been made.  She does not respond well to queries and refuses to alter previous decisions.  My deductible was $1,200 per year but routine well adult office visits and tests are covered 100% when the doctor codes things the way they should be coded.  After sending results to Aetna they agreed that the doctor was incorrect. She also called me 'skinny' when my weight is exactly correct for my height.  I should be permitted to charge her for the time I spent on phone calls, faxes and communication over her bad decision.  ",-1

After testing me only for celiac and having a colonoscopy he diagnosed me with IBS & sent me on my way with a pamphlet that he authored in college about IBS.  I went back for a second opinion, and the second doctor had me submit a fecal fat test which showed a significant amount of fat passing through unabsorbed.  I then returned to Dr. Utts who proceeded to treat me like I was mentally unstable at every appointment & refused to even acknowledge the fat test by saying the lab &quot;probably messed it up&quot;.  He didn't take it well that I didn't agree with his faulty IBS diagnosis  He then had me take Xifaxan which I couldn't tolerate, and after a Pill Cam study turned up nothing he basically told me he wasn't going to help me any more and that I should go somewhere else.

All to lose 10lbs in a week. Oook. I had my regular MD fax a request for my medical records when we were tweaking some of my many medications. The records were never sent. I had to transport it myself. Read my file and found that they listed my shortness of breath as caused by being over weight and that I eat chocolate 3X a day. I have hereditary allergic asthma and I had an inhaler listed with my medications that I take daily. I eat sweets of any sort maybe once a week.

She took us into her office and was very helpful and understanding as well as compassionate. She let me have the option to let it go naturally or to have a D and C, and suggested the D and C might be less traumatic. She was right. Two months later, we were pregnant naturally with twins. Dr. Umholtz was amazing throughout the whole pregnancy. She listened and was attentive. At 35 weeks, one of the twins had slowed growth, and after discussing it, she decided we should have a C Section the following day. She was very efficient in surgery and with followup.

I agreed to surgery to remove the cyst but desperately wanted to save my ovary.  However she kept on going on about the possibility of cancer even though I had explained several times that there is a family history.  She promised to inform my waiting husband and mother as soon as she determined the nature of the cyst.  Did she&#63; No.  She removed my ovary despite my fertility concerns.  My mother (a doctor OB GYN-trained herself) asked Dr Umholtz numerous questions that she could not satisfactorily answer.  Post operative office visits were unprofessional.  She frequently mistook my medical history and records for other patients even as it related to medication.  This woman once gave me a physical exam so forcefully that I thought she was tearing my insides out.

When I had questions for her she looked at me like i was stupid for asking. I planned to have a natural birth and Dr. umholtz was aware of it.  But in my transition stage of labor she suggested that I have a c-section or go on with labor pains for hours or maybe days.  At this time--the idea seemed like an option because I was in so much pain. And I decided to have a c-section since after 3 hrs my daughter had not moved down my cervix.

I was diagnosed and received relief for the pain without pain meds. My sister was referred by me due to a 2 year problem with pain in her left arm and shoulder. No other Dr. would run tests and he ordered test on the first visit to find Arterial issues that needed surgery immediatly.  He saved her life. Please listen to what he says and he can improve your life or even save it. ",1

I wasted time with this guy and he had no clue what was causing the problem. This doctor is as good as it gets. Try is or take my words and look for a better Neurologist practice beside this place called DALLAS PA something. These morons are the oncall doctors for Hospital in Dallas Baylor in Downtown so don't expect much help from the hospital or doctor affiliation. Total of my time waste. ,-1

2687,36252,1.0,staff and doctor are not concerned with the welfare of patients- only to get you in and out ASAP- Dr.  Updegrove has NO time to listen and forgets what you tell him after 5 minutes- receptionist is RUDE and nurse can not follow up on what she needs to do ,-1
2688,36253,0.0,"Last 3 times I went it took over 1 hour. I waited over 30 minutes before I was called in and another 20 to see her and the entire visit last over 1 hour, most of which was just waiting for either the nurse or the doctor.

Her staff wasn't any better. . not unpleasant but not pleasant either. .  Two visits to her in total and I would not go back or recommend her to anyone else. My husband also found her communication skills lacking; she is obviously skilled in her knowledge but clueless about the need for her to allow for a dialogue to address any patient concerns. Office personnel with the prevous doctor was a contrast of night and day (she took over an existing practice). A textbook example of what is experienced when the doctor/patient are not on the same page re expectations. ",1

When you are the one in the delivery room though- you want the Doctor worried about you and not how long his patients are waiting on him, his trained staff can handle this.

Another rater had it right: the wait time is excessive, he is not on call over the weekend, etc., and I have not had much luck with his choices in nurse practitioners, but I have been willing to overlook these things because he is so great with my kids.  He does not overreact to symptoms by requesting all kinds of testing and does not give you a prescription for every sniffle.  He has been our pediatrician for 5 years, and I wouldn't change. ",1

2705,36258,1.0,"Have gone to Dr. Unite for 3.5 years. He is very helpful, doesn't mind a million questions (for the first time parent), and patient. The only bad things are: wait time in the office can at times be pretty long, his appts are usually booked out far in advance, and the docs aren't on call on the weekend. You have to call a nurse hotline, and if your call doesn't result in an ER trip, you get billed $13.  ",1

2712,36261,1.0,"Dr. Urueta is a very helpful to patients and their parents. He will explain and ask questions until he feels certain that you're well informed of your child's medical problem.

He is quick to respond if need be with the team of doctors seeing her for her condition.

2729,36264,1.0,"Dr. Ulanoski is not a very knowledgable when it comes to pediatrics.  He not only misdiagnosed my son twice, he sent us to the ER four times in two weeks without coming up with a single result!  Knowing that our son had been on Pedialyte for 2 plus days and vomitting, he sent us home telling us to continue feeding our son the same manner.  Our son soon became even more ill do to malnutrition and was place in the hospital for dehydration and excessive vomitting.  After a four day stay in the hospital, we were still asking for an answer to our sons health problems.  The best conclusion Dr. Ulanoski could give us is that our son must have come down with some type of virus.   When put on the spot about his plan of actions for our sons health, he denied his actions for making the decisions he made.  Terrible Doctor.  ",-1

2734,36269,1.0,"I just wanted to say that Dr. Updyke provided us with the same 'service'. My daughter has a fused tooth, which he made a big deal about to his whole office, and was probably the only reason he took XRays... Anyway, he told us the tooth needed to come out ASAP and then relayed the same story about the traveling anesthesiologist. He also stated that he would have to shut down his office during the procedure--which we would have to pay for!! After seeing the other rating on this dentist, we are definitely getting a second opinion!! ",-1
2735,36269,1.0,I took my son to see Dr. Updyke when I noticed some decay in my son's molar. He never took nor even recommended X-ray exams. He immediately said that I would have to put in under general anaesthesia by a traveling anaesthesiologist (not in a hospital!). He also stated that if I did not use general anaesthesia that I would horrify my son and he would be screaming from pain. I found a fantastic dentist (who took X-rays) who sedated my son with demerol and it worked out wonderfully. Dr. Updyke failed to notice that my son needed a mini-root canal and blamed the sippy cup (and hence me) for all the problems. ,-1
2736,36270,1.0,I now live in Florida and realize that Dr. Uy was the best doctor I have ever had.  He takes the time to explain and even goes as far as drawing pictures and charts just to explain it even clearer.  I miss him dearly and wish there were a doctor like him in the Fort Myers area.   Don't take him for granted because from what I have been experencing Good Doctors are Hard to Find!! ,1
2737,36270,1.0,"Of the endocrinologists I've had, Dr. Uy was one of the better ones. He was kind and competent, and did help me get my insulin pump. His staff was excellent, and I found his diabetes educator, Mickey Reyes, to be very helpful. My biggest complaint, though, was that in that practice they herded you through like a bunch of cattle most of the time. I don't think he ever spent more than 5 minutes with me, and I had oodles of questions that never got answered because of that. But if you're not the type with a lot of questions, he is a nice and smart doctor. Depends on what you're looking for.  ",1

The EMS team suspected a gall bladder attack when I was in excruciating pain for over an hour and then it suddenly subsided and disappeared shortly after they arrived. When I followed up with Dr. Ukwade, she listened and didn't make me feel like a fool. She ordered tests, and they confirmed the diag. of my bad gallbladder. Within a month, I had another horrible attack and ended up having emergency surgery.  My point is that Dr. Ukwade listened to me. Ever since then, I have felt confident in her knowledge and expertise. The wait used to be much longer when she was with a group, but she always devoted equal time to me and her other patients. She never made me feel like I was on a conveyor belt. Now that she has her own office, things are superb. She has a friendly, caring staff,and when calling,you don't end up on a voice mail loop. Dr. Ukwade is very attentive,usually prompt,and interested in your health care.  ",1

Everyone in the office is rude and trashy--if you actually HAVE insurance like I do, they treat you like an outcast.  They assume everyone has Medicaid.  The office and staff are dirty and they never have the right vaccinations available.  It cost me $70 to get my 10 month old's cough checked.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when he left several unreturned messages for the doctor and then received a very curt, unapologetic message from a nurse after 8 hours. He ASked to have Dr. VB call, and he still never received a follow up call! It's all about the billing at Hillcroft Medical, no phone calls or warm bedside manner..its all about the $$!

She is the mother of five and truly understands a woman's situation through all phases of life.  She is highly trained and the type of person who is actively involved in updating her own level of knowledge.  She is smart, quick and confident.  She is also a good listener and takes the time to understand each patient's needs.  Because of this, you could wait longer than average to see her.  But when it's your turn, it's worth it. ",1

I have never went on a site and rated any of the doctors I have seen but the poor service this doctor provided compelled me to rate him. My first visit was horrible, without actually knowing my situation he began to tell me what he was going to do. He takes me off, my pain medication which I have been on for over 8 years without as much as &quot;sir what are you on&quot;. Then the medication he puts me on needs pre-authorization from my insurance and it takes his staff two whole weeks to get the denial. So I had to go without medication for two weeks when I suffer from chronic siatic back pain all day everyday. I had to take off work. Now mind you I explained all this to the doctor but all he did was give me excuses and &quot;sir I know what I am doing&quot;. Anyway, DO NOT GO TO THIS DOC!WARNING,WARNING, WARNING.  ",-1

But  Dr Vache was kind and warm.  She worked with me to adjust my medications when needed and seemed to know a lot about my issues and medications without having to reference my paperwork.  I could tell she'd familiarized herself with my files before we met, and I was immediately comfortable.  It's been a while since I've seen her, as I was able to move on without medication after a while.  But I would definitely recommend her to anyone needing help. ",1

The next time I saw him I told him that I did not want Cipro so he put me on Levaquin which is worse than Cipro. It started causing problems so he took me off of Levaquin with caused the infection to become resistant. The infection caused problems with my prostate that after 9 months I am still trying to get back to normal. If he would have just listened to me and put me on something different then I would have been fine. He does what he wants and ignores what the patient is telling him. Stay away from him and find a different doctor. I am seeing a great doctor in Plano which is a long drive for me, but well worth the drive. I am finally getting back to somewhat normal.  ",-1

2849,36324,0.0,Dr.Valdes is awesome however my only compliant is her office and billing staff. They constantly bill me incorrectly even after they receive information from my insurance company about my benefits. The office/nursing staff are young and have not yet learned any bedside manner. Dr. Valdes is knowledgeable and she cares but i could not deal with the incompetent staff.I had to follow up for 4 months for a $200.00 refund from the billing department since there is only one woman working in it and she doesnt know how to run the office. I only hoped Dr. Valdes would get better staff and i would gladly go back to her.  ,1
2850,36325,2.0,Be aware of their hidden charge. I received a bill today. It's regarding a developmental questionaire during the visit. The insurance doesn't cover it. Be careful and make sure you ask them before you answered the questions.  ,1

Noone knew how to fill out scripts in his office.  Crooks! ,-1

After waiting over an hour in the waiting room and than another 30 minutes for him to see us we were graced with his presence. He started his exam with my son and was extremely insensative to his pain. After being told my son needed surgery we were told to give he the presciption of pain meds that his staff would call in.  I went to the pharmacy to pick it up and they never called it in.  I called the after hours and no one picked up.  This is the worst doctors office I've ever seen.  ,-1
2855,36327,1.0,"After two years of doctors, Dr Valastro was the first one to not send me away with a huge bottle of pills.  He seemed interested in my well being and in my future.  Was a refreshing change from the numerous other doctors.  And he also didn't recommend surgery.  As a last resort it could be done but it isn't an option at the moment.  Thanks Dr. V.  ",1
2856,36327,1.0,"I saw Dr. V for hyaluronic acid injections in my knee.  He botched the job and said my knee was in very bad shape. He said giving the injection was very difficult and it was PAINFUL.  Hid PA gave me one of my injections and it was completely painless and in the correct spot.  I almost passed out during the last injection Dr. V gave me.

2857,36327,1.0,"I had fallen over my dogs and broken a finger. No big deal, thought it would heal. After 3 weeks, it was still swolled, bruised and deformed. Saw Dr. Valastro. What a joke! Waited one hour and 15 minutes in the waiting room, and 30 minutes in the office. Finally got an x-ray. Then waited another 20 minutes for him to walk in the room. He told me I had &quot;arthritis.&quot; I told him that was funny, since I didn't have it before I fell, my finger wasn't swollen, wasn't bruised and wasn't deformed. His response was he didn't know what to tell me. The next day, I saw another Dr. at an acute care facility. The finger was broken in 2 places. After he set it (because it was completely out of alignment) it felt much better. It healed, although now it really does have arthritis. Dr. Valastro is probably one of the worst Dr.'s I have ever encountered. ",-1

I cant sit or stand for anything length of time without great discomfort. I have been unable to get any help from Dr. Valastro. Every time I went to him after the surgery and complained of the pain, he insisted he saw nothing wrong.  ",-1
2859,36327,1.0,He was horrible.  My husband had a broken hip and he insisted it was heeling. He made my husband go back to work in severe pain when it was completely broken. after 2 months he put in a partial hip and then he could not walk.  He gave up and gave him a list of doctors in the area. That was the only good that happened.  He also would make us wait at least one hour before he would see us and never would apoligize. He was incompetant.  I feel that he needs to do something else certainly Not surgery.  ,-1

2862,36329,1.0,"I liked this doctor very much, he performed a D &amp; C and removed a cyst and an ovary.....all and all I would rate the overall experience EXCELLENT, only problem was afterwards when his office kept billing me small amounts and that was after I had paid the co-pay upfront and the insurance paid the rest. I ekpt asking for an explanation but never got it ---just the bills. I finally apd them but was not happy about it. Sometimes I think they send you all these small amounts for $30 -$50 bucks hoping you'll just pay and avoid a big hassle --which I did. But I trust this doctor and he came with a high recommendation from another surgeon another fmaily member had. He's a good surgeon and bedside manner is good too....  ",1

2866,36329,1.0,He was an excellent no nonsense doctor who I really liked.  I have been going there for over 7 years and I have never had a bad experience with him.

2868,36330,0.0,About 8 years ago she misdiagnosed my husband as having a stroke.  The hospital imaging reports indicated Multiple Sclerosis but her lack of knowledge - stating that he was a man and too old - resulted in altogether wrong treatment.  It took 3 years to get the correct diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.  He is now treated in an MS clinic no thanks to this neurologist.  I could not recommend her.  ,-1
2869,36330,0.0,"I believe she became a doctor to truly help others.  Kind, attentive, confident, generous with her time, and has my best interest at heart.  She is understanding and generally interested in me as a patient. She doesn't push new and expensive medication.  ",1

2871,36331,0.0,"I could not disagree more with the previous comments, especially in regard to the thoroughness of Dr. Vander Straten's exams.  She has always been extremely thorough in my exams and she has never pushed any expensive or trendy treatments.  A good old-fashioned Doc.  That's why I followed her from her former clinic to her current clinic at Lone Star.  ",1
2872,36331,0.0,"I was very concerned upon leaving Dr. Vander Straten's office.  I felt she was in the pocket of the rosacea pharmaceutical manufacturers.  That's all she could talk about even though I told her the diagnosis of my previous dermatologist, who did a superior job in my previous home.  The prescription for rosacea did nothing for my cystic acne, and brought on new problems.  The redness of rasacea that I never had, now erupted on my face.  I discontinued the prescription immediately. I hope you look for someone who responds with an intelligent discussion to your subjective comments.  And their objective exam takes more than 3 seconds.  It was a shear formality.  ",-1
2873,36332,0.0,"I would not return to this Dr's office.  They are very rude and unwilling to help. The hours are terrible and you can NEVER get ahold of a human being, nor is there an option to leave a voicemail so they can return my call when they are actually open. I have to take up my time continuously calling &amp; calling back until I can get through to someone on the phone. Very time consuming &amp; hectic. They take days to return a phone call and there has been a few times when they never even returned the call.  Forget trying to get them to call in a prescription. There were times when they never called the pharmacy and I had to start the whole process of calling them back.  They are in a hurry to get you in and get rid of you.  Very stressful visits.  ",-1

2876,36334,0.0,Dr. Varghese is Extremely helpful. All the products she sells at her practice are 100% natural and very helpful as well. She is not always on time but she is very busy doing hosptal visits in the mornings. She always has a smile on her face which makes it almost impossible not to smile. She is very optimistic and full of life. I would reccomend her to anyone with heart troubles. She is truly amazing ,1
2877,36335,1.0,"This man is either careless or uncaring, or both. My primary doctor referred to Dr. Varin for chronic diarrhea. The examination included an uncomfortable exam of the rectum but his written report stated that a rectal exam was not performed. My calls to his office for a corrected report were to no avail. Consequently, Dr. Varin subjected me to a stressful procedure, wasted my time and money, and after failing to correct the error in his report, left me with no alternative but to undergo a duplicate exam in order to get needed information to the referring physician. I can understand making an error when dictating a report; I can't understand refusing to correct the error after multiple requests from me to do so, nor giving me even the simple courtesy of returning my phone calls.

2882,36338,0.0,"I was recently operated on by Dr. Vaden and I am very pleased.  I had colon resectioning surgery in which about 10 inches of my right ascending colon was removed because of a cancerous tumor.  She was able to do laparoscopic surgery on me versus open surgery even though I have several layers of belly fat which I'm sure made it extremely difficult.  Because I'm diagnosed at Stage IIa colon cancer, she suggested I obtain a second opinion about receiving chemotheraphy which I'm glad I did as it is not warranted at this time based on tumor not going outside the colon wall; high number of lymph nodes tested were negative and other criteria regarding tumor type, etc.  Dr. Vaden is a straight shooter and tells you like it is which I truly appreciate because that's exactly how I am with people.  I would recommend her to other patients having to have colon resectioning surgery.  Also, her operating room nurses think very highly of her; I know, because I grilled them before my operation.   lol ",1

2884,36338,0.0,"Dr Vaden may be good at her job, but has no inter-personal skills. After surgery, I had to go to the emergency room (I had some breathing issues, nausea, pain in my chest) and she was very upset and angry at me for doing so and mentioned the cost of tests and the visit. I don't know what connection to the insurance company she has but after surgery she was supposed to see my family and never called them. She said she walked out and no one was there so she went on to her next surgery. My mom waited the entire day and didn't eat because she wanted to be there when they called the family. She just doesn't communicate well. On a follow up visit recommended by the ER doctor, she said my tests were normal (although they indicated I had partial lung collapse and an infection). She continued to be dismissive. I had just had surgery and she was angrily speaking to me as if I was a child in front of my spouse. We didn't know what to say. We just felt shocked my her comments and attitude.  ",-1

Dr.V has worked patiently to find the meds that worked best for me. He's always been quick to return calls and always answered my questions making sure that I fully understood my illness & treatment plan.I was Dr. V's last appt one afternoon but was thirty minutes late. I didn't have my cell phone and I was worried that the office would be closed. Dr. V had let his staff go home but he had stayed & waited for me.

2891,36341,1.0,"This Dr. nearly killed me. I had 1 visit. He hardly inquired of my symptoms but put me on 5 Rx's. My body degrading w/in 3 days. Shaking too much to hold spoon to eat. Leg muscles failed. had to lay on floor to eat from bowl like a dog. Called Dr. w/ symptoms & asked if E.R. required. He yelled at me & replied, &quot;I can't talk to you while you're being passive-agressive.&quot; I asked what that meant (so I could stop & he'd hear me). He refused to explain. I could not live like this anymore. I hung up & was about to slit wrists when friend knocked on door, stopped me, took me to local free MHMR facility next day. Pschiatrist there heard me. Looked at Rx's & remarked, &quot;It's a miracle you din't die.&quot; I thought he meant suicide, but he said, &quot;No, these Rx combinations are deadly when mixed.&quot; Verified all symptoms they'd give & I had them. He switched me to 2 Rx's which removed all symptoms & was able to become employed w/in 2 weeks. / Vasavada should not be allowed near humans.  ",-1
2892,36341,1.0,"Dr. Vasavada was great. He changed my medicines which made a tremendous difference in my mental health. He was concerned about how I was doing in every appointment, which was almost everyday. I was a patient at University Behavioral Health in Denton. I was being treated for self-injury. Dr. V. understands the particular problem and treats the patient with respect and is not judgmental at all. S.I. is a difficult syndrome to treatment and requires a doctor who is knowledgeable about it. Dr. V. is! My fellow S.I. patients agree that Dr. V. is a wonderful doctor.  ",1
2893,36341,1.0,"At first he was very helpful, but after 4 years under his care he became very complacent in his treatment of me.  I felt ignored and mistreated.  I feel i gave him feasible knowledge of my behaviors and experiences.  Often his answer became associated more with deep stares upon his computer screen and less about the person sitting 2 feet away from him.  Even more so his receptionists are not caring and only justify their experience with you among the time it takes to get out your credit card.  Often witnessed individuals come into the office crying and pleading their case for emergency treatment, and simply told they had not the time or the energy to care for these sick individuals.  I simple suggest consider the personal connection you recieve with Dr. Vasavada, while in his presence.  I feel you will percieve the same opinion of him of which i have explained. ",-1
2894,36341,1.0,"This man saved my life.  After going to a dr that sent me into a nervous breakdown from poor practices, Dr V. brought me back from the brink in record speed and I am a whole new person for it.  I won't say every day is sunshine and roses, but he has taught me what to watch for and how to avoid the pitfalls.  I would recommend anyone with more normal everyday &quot;issues&quot; go talk to him.  If he helped me he can surely help someone else out there and don't wait.  He's the best.

Within 2 monthly visits I was requesting to be seen by Dr. Valdez only and switched my primary healthcare to Dr. Valdez because I knew he was the right doctor for me.

2914,36349,0.0,"Dr. Van Sickle is a wonderful doctor. She is very knowledgable, you just have to draw the information out of her. She is very direct, but it is understandable, because she is a doctor. She asks specific questions and seeks a specific answer, not a story. I prefer this in a doctor as it gets things moving along. You just need to be prepared when you go in if you have a few questions. Have a list and be prepared. The bed side manner was a bit rocky at first, but I realized that it was a two way street. The more personable I became, the more personable she became. Sounds like how people actually act. The wait is a bit long, but depends on what you are having done. The longest I have waited is 45 minutes, but sometimes I am in and out in 15 minutes. This is how it is at every doctor. Our family doctor and pediatrician have 30 minute waits as well. My husband really likes her because she is direct, specific, and practical. A good doctor to cut through the drama and worries of the world.  ",1
2915,36349,0.0,"We had initially planned on using her as our obstetrician, but quickly changed our minds. She has a terrible bedside manner and clearly does not want to answer patient's questions.

2916,36349,0.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Van Sickle for several years.  She was the first doctor to diagnose the reason for my infertility.  She recommended a treatment plan and was very helpful.

I would recommend her to anyone wanting a compasionate doctor.  ,1
2917,36349,0.0,I have mixed emotions about Dr. Van Sickle.  While I believe she is very knowledgeable I think she sometimes makes her patients feel stupid.  I trust her and like her as a doctor but would not recommend her to someone who can get their feelings hurt.  She can be very up front and almost too much.  Overall great Dr. for the right person.  ,1
2918,36349,0.0,"I went Van Sickle after high recommendations from several people.  This was hands down the WORST experience I have ever had with a &quot;Dr.&quot;  She hurt me very badly during the exam, I bled for 3 days after, and then had the nerve to accuse me of trying to nothing more then sue her.  She was incredibly late more than 2 1/2 hrs, and staff kept lying about the wait time.  I had a Hypoglycemic episode because of the long wait, she simply said it was my fault for not asking for soda or crackers from her staff.  At point she threw down her pen and told me she only wanted patients with a positive attitude, because she didn't have to put up with negativity. Dr's are supposed to make you feel better not worse.

2922,36349,0.0,I went to her for my  pap smear and several prenatal visit. I and my husband decided to change my OB/GYN in the middle of my pregnancy because of her attitude. she is not nice at all; no bedside manner; very sarcastic in all her comments about our questions. ,-1
2923,36349,0.0,She was rude and very judgmental of me since I was going through a difficult divorce.  It was a rough time for me and she only made it worse with her condescending remarks.

Gentle, competent, caring, calm, reassuring, and she was rated as one of the Top Docs in Houston. I am so grateful. I also use Dr. Van Sickle as my primary doc--she and her awesome nurse, Chris, kindly have referred me to very good doctors when I've needed someone. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  ",1
2925,36350,1.0,I was very unhappy with my visit with this doctor and his staff.  There was zero communication between he and the nurse I spoke with when I made the appointment and he had no knowledge of why I was there...even after I explained it.  He then proceeded to make me feel ashamed and embarrassed for my situation.  I was then instructed to follow another nurse who was extremely dismissive and rude.  The girl at the front desk was the only positive experience I had there.  Overall I was highly offended by how I was treated and would never recommend this doctor to anyone. ,-1
2926,36350,1.0,"I would not suggest this doctor or his staff! They are rude and are quick to stick their noses up to you if you do not have insurance and are asking for a cash pay discount. They don't do that there. Even after paying an insane amount of money, they had the audacity to send me a bill for something they forgot to charge me with. Dr. Valdez was less than impressive. He seemed pretty apathetic when I went to see him for a miscarriage. I started crying when he told me, asked me if I was going to be okay and then left the room immediately after. He didn't try to make me feel better or explain why it may have happened. He just left me on the table. I had the worst experience there and I hope that no one else has that same experience. ",-1
2927,36350,1.0,"I have been with Dr. Valdez for about 3 years.  After a year of trying to conceive, his advice and assistance helped us get pregnant, and he delivered our son almost a year ago.

Our delivery was very professional (at St. Lukes) and went perfectly.  ",1
2928,36350,1.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Valdez for about 17 years. He delivered my baby and has always provided me with excellenet service. I find him to be very patient, courteous and helpful.

2929,36350,1.0,"I recently underwent major surgery that was performed by Dr. Valdez.  Absolutely minimal pain postoperatively (1 or 2 out of 10).  He ensured that I had everything I needed.  He even checked with me after I went home.  Can't ask for more!!!  Dr. Valdez is great and I can never say anything bad about him.  You are an excellent physician and I would rather you be blunt and honest, than to beat around the bush and lie.  ",1
2930,36350,1.0,Dr Valdez is a great doctor.  He can be blunt at times but I would rather have that then someone to sugar coat things.  I trust him completely when it comes to my pregnancies as well as my gyno needs.  The nurses are always very helpful on the phone!  would very much recommend him to others.  ,1
2931,36350,1.0,I have been with Dr. Valdez for many years and have never had any problems with him. He is excellent and very helpful when questions are asked.  I have never heard him being rude to patients!!  As far as punctuality...he delivers babies...he can never know when a baby will want to be delivered.  It would be unfair to rate a OB/GYN in this category unless you have to wait for hours knowing the doctor is in the house.  I will continue to seeing Dr. Valdez for as long as he is in practice.  ,1
2932,36350,1.0,i have been with valdez for over 13 years now he is the best obgyn. very helpful answers all my questions.  the staff is just the same.  i recommend his office! ,1

2934,36350,1.0,Worst experience at a doctor appointment ever.  I scheduled an extra appointment to discuss my husband and I trying to concieve.  Dr. Valdez said well you have two options lose 50 pounds or realize that some people are just not meant to be parents.  I am overweight at about 215 pounds but not morbidly obese and I have been exactly the same weight for the last 10 years.  This advice was not only not helpful but also given in a very rude way.  After this emotional blow he even sat there in the exam room and just waited until I left not even giving me time to get myself back togather.  Dr. Valdez is FIRED in my book and I will be making an appointment with another doctor tommorrow.  ,-1
2935,36350,1.0,Wonderful experience! Helpful staff and the doctor was GREAT.  ,1
2936,36350,1.0,"This may be the worst I've ever been treated by a doctor. He insisted I get a pap smear even though that was not what I scheduled the appointment for, because it would be a &quot;waste of time&quot; to do it later. He actually took the time to ask me a question--have you ever taken birth control pills. As I was answering that they give me depression and weight gain, he cut me off mid-sentence to say he was putting me back on &quot;the pill&quot;! He cut me off again mid-sentence to give me a completely dischordant answer several times! He seemed more interested in chatting with his nurse about totally nonrealed topics than providing something that would resemble health care. Mean mean doc, to be avoided at all costs! I've had the same luck with other doctors associated with Institute for Women's Health, so I avoid them altogether now.  ",-1

2946,36356,0.0,"I used Dr Varadi for 8 years as my regular gynecologist. I was on the pill and had no issues. In 2009, when I went off the pill and attempted to conceive, I self-diagnosed myself with PCOS after  7 months of no ovulation, I went in for an official diagnosis. Once she diagnosed me, she gave me no options for treatment. Her suggestions were to go back on the pill to decrease the symptoms (hello! I was trying to conceive!) or lose 40 pounds (I weighed about 165 at 5'8&quot;). Um, no. I ended up going to see an RE, who put me on metformin for my PCOS. I got pregnant within 6 weeks, but miscarried. When I called Varadi to report it, they did nothing. No tests, no visit, nothing.  The second time I got pregnant, 3 months later, I scheduled a blood test with Varadi to confirm, but they still didn't want to see me for 4 weeks, even though I had a prior miscarriage! That's when I decided to switch doctors. And what a great decision that was. Never regretted it. ",1
2947,36356,0.0,The worst doc I'v ever seen. Complete disrespect for patients. Yelled and insulted me for wanting to know the reason to be induced.  It's not as if there are no other obgyns in the area!! Why is she even in practice!!! ,-1
2948,36356,0.0,Best doctor I ever had to determine what my medical problem was.  I always feel I can communicate with her.  ,1
2949,36356,0.0,"I feel like Dr. Varadi does NOT value her patient's time. I have waited long wait times, and this has severely hindered my husband getting to enjoy his first pregnancy. Most of the time, he has to leave before the dr even arrives. She is normally about 30-45 minutes late to appt times, and then only spends maybe a minute or two before walking out the door. It's very frustrating. Most of the information I have needed I have turned to online sources for. I have to constantly ask for silly things like what my baby's heartbeat is, as she doesn't tell you while doing the Doppler. She has yet to measure my uterus like my previous ob did when I was pregnant with my other two children. I just feel like she's only there now to make a buck, and she really isn't all that concerned about her patients.  ",-1
2950,36356,0.0,I've seen her for 12 years. She and her staff are excellent! I wouldn't see anyone else. ,1
2951,36356,0.0,"I went to her for over 6 years and she was never on time.  I also had two miscarriages while she was my Dr, which was never investigated nor were my irregular periods.  In fact, she had &quot;forgotten&quot; that I had one miscarriage (despite it being in my file) when my second happened.  I recently switched Dr's and they quickly discovered what was wrong and diagnosed me with PCOS.  I feel like the ball was severely dropped on her and her staff's part.  ",-1
2952,36356,0.0,"Dr Varadi handled my high risk pregnancy and efficiently handled my delivery. She & her staff are knowledgeable and helpful. I have recomended friends and they have similar good experience. As for the wait, as someone mentioned, me being a high risk pregnancy, from personal experience, have seen Dr Varadi drop her appointments and rush to an emergency when needed, and I appreciate her for that.

2953,36356,0.0,"She is never on time. I have waited for over 2 hours sometimes and mostly at least 45 mins before she sees you. After you wait that long the doctor actually only spends 30 seconds with you in the room and rushes out before answering any questions. Staff are very curt and not at all helpful. They sigh and make a face if you ask questions. They are not open to having hte baby naturally or vaginally (with or without epidural). They force C-section on you from the time you are close to your due date. After my delivery when I was fully conscious, the doctor was telling her colleague that she is going to write it up as a 2nd deg episiotomy because she got written up for to many 3rd deg. Now that made me feel very secure. My water broke on oct 6 and I did not deliver baby till Oct 17 and this was in spite of me telling the doctor that I think my water broke. she examined me, did a sono and sent me home. The whole experience has scarred me and I will never ever go back to her.  ",-1

I have seen her several times with multi medical problems. I have called needing to be seen the same day and was able to get in.  I have also walked in expecting to wait at least 30- 45 minutes but only waited 15 minutes to see the PA.

2989,36372,0.0,"Dr. Van Der Leden is in the office about 1% of the time. I've only ever seen her once in two years. Her staff has an incredible turnover and she expects them to handle the patients instead of doing it herself. She falsely advertises her hours on her door, her website, and her answering service. She claims to accept walk-in patients, but it's difficult for  established patients to make appointments because the office hours are really very limited. She expects her P.A. and nurse to not only see patients, but to answer the phone and make appointments. I think she is only about making money and I don't think she cares about her patients that much at all.  Why did she become a doctor&#63; ",-1
2990,36372,0.0,"The Dr. is fairly good and takes the time to listen...but her staff turns over at an incredible rate. WHY&#63; Her current nurse talks too  much about her own personal situations.She is careless, letting the needle slip out too soon as she was taking my blood. Forgets to write things in my chart. She called to give me the results and told me things that I later found out weren't even in my results. She is the reason I may be looking for a new Dr. Also, the Dr. seems to want you to have an awful lot of tests done on a regular basis. Will only give 3 month supply on prescriptions which causes you to have to go in more often. She was gone all summer so I had to see another Dr. in her place. I've also noticed the her co-Doctor's seem to also turn over at an unusual rate.

After running a few blood test and an EKG. Dr. Vall wanted to release my father who was in so much pain and so weak he could not walk. My brother insisted that they at the very least transport him by ambulance to another hospital. Dr. Valle argued and stated that there was nothing wrong, after my brother screamed, yelled and insisted my father be treated, another Dr. was assigned. In the end my father was diagnosed with Accute Bacterial Endocarditis. He spent months in the hospital, with part of that time being spent in ICU.

A clear distinguised metaphor between angels of the light and those who hide/hinder/cover up and conspire with very little faith living on the dark side.  And let me tell you Dr. Nelson Valena is fullfilled with love & light, Thanks be to God he is a blessing and I am not even sure if he really knows just how blessed he is yet.

The tooth plus another needs a root canal.  I left still in pain and went to an endodontist and had the root canals done, temporaries put in. I followed up after two weeks as instructed, they can not get me in for four weeks. But the temporary is falling out. She said not to worry about it, but there is decay behind and she would not suggest filling it. It needs a new crown.  Now you tell me and I still don't have an appointment.

To anyone complaining about a long wait, just remember it could be because she takes the time to comfort a patient and she will spend as much time with you or your child if it's needed.  I had what I will call a &quot;little panic attack&quot; and she stopped everything to help me.  I'm sure that had to cause her to run behind.  Her staff has always been good to me also.  ",1

I will be issuing a complaint with The Texas State Board of Dentistry.  Also I told them I was going to post remarks such as this on every review system out on the net to inform other potential patients of Dr Van Pelt's disregard to her patients time.

When I was seen by the doctor during the next appointment I found that I did not need antibiotic.  They did the same test every time I went there.  It appears that especially the flow test is a good way to run up the bill.  When I complain about this his rude staff asked me why did I accept.  Well...I trusted the doctor then and I thought he had ordered it.  He may have good bed side manners but the overall office performance lacks ",1

They did not care about my discomfort and when I would call back to try and get a nurse on the phone they were very rude.

I have very high confidence in his diagnostic skills and in his surgical skills.  PROBLEMS:  (1)  The Doctor or his RN take DAYS to return questions left with the office staff.  (2)  The office staff has been there for years and they officiously treat you like you are an intrusion on their life.

While his nursing staff were always nice, Dr. Waechter himself was rude, and he never explained to me what was going on in my pregnancy. During my first visit Dr. Waechter told me that if I had any questions I should tell the nurse before I saw him so that she could write them down for him to answer at his convenience. Unfortunately my first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. I am now pregnant again, and my new doctor informed me that I have B Negative blood. In the event of a miscarriage, birth, or abortion women with Negative blood type need to get a certain shot to insure that their bodies don't produce antibodies that may harm future pregnancies by causing birth defects or even death. Dr. Waechter did not even care to inform me about my blood type. It hurts to know that someone could have such a serious occupation and not care about his patients. I will not use Dr. Waechter again, nor will I recommend anyone to him.  ",-1

3041,36393,1.0," was &quot;treated&quot; by Dr John W. Wages.  He rushed through the appointment, nor did not explain possible issues. He recommended an xray and physical therapy.  I asked what he would be looking for in the xray, and his response was we will address that when the xrays were back.  I asked what the physical therapy was going to address, his response was the therapist will tell me.  He left the room, and an assistant came in to go over the meds, and I asked if the Dr was done with me. He informed me he was, so I requested his return since I had several more questions.  Dr Wages then returned, standing in the doorway, asked if I had any questions.  He never stepped in the room, and ended each answer stating do you have another question...When I stated I would only see another Dr in the group, they terminated care for me - Waste of time, money, and reflects, in my opinion, the worst type of medical care - indifference to a patient and their concerns.  ",-1
3042,36393,1.0," The procedure applied was accurate and likely well executed.  He totally dropped the ball on my &quot;care&quot;.  The procedure was supposed to be one of several.  He did the first and never followed up. Candidly, I thought he was only providing the procedure as an out sourced service.   I was un aware my physician transferred my care to Dr. Wages.   Dr. Wages did not expain the process or on going steps required.   When I phoned to follow up with him was the most disappointing part.  He absolutely refused to speak with me.  He was evasive.  He used his staff as a foil.  It seems odd to use this adjective, but he was a coward.  I think he was happy with the payment he got for the insurance and he was done with the patient. Uncaring.  A genuine lack of concern for the patient and the treatment he provides.  ",-1
3043,36394,1.0," Looking for a FAMILY doctor whose office and deameanor offers a small town feel&#63;  Dr. Wade is the best fit.  My family has been using this physician for 23 years.  He’s knowledgeable, caring and also has a great sense of humor.  Dr. Wade will always use wording easily understood to the general public rather than bombarding you with medical terminology.  I know that I can call Dr. Wade and get an appointment anytime I need one.  Never have they refused to see me when I was ill because they were too busy.  So on occasion, when I have to wait in the lobby past my appointment time, I do not get annoyed.  I know he is “working in” another patient who needed a last minute appointment.  Once your turn arrives, he will be thorough during the visit and you are never made to feel rushed.  He’s just “good folk” down to his cowboy boots! ",1

3045,36394,1.0," I don't like Dr Wade at all.  I thought he was alright when I was going to him, but it turned out I was suffering form a chronic and potentially debilitating condition that was causing me pain and suffering for many years (2-3).  Dr Wade and I discussed my problems many times over those years, and the most Dr Wade ever did for me was recommend I get better shoes.  He stopped taking my insurance forcing me me to get another doctor which turned out to be a blessing.  The new doctor did not ignore my complaints and we eventually found out what was wrong with me, and proper treatment has made my life much better.  Diagnostic tests have confirmed I was suffering from a chronic disease and treatment has eliminated my pain, and been borne out in the lab results.  ",-1
3046,36394,1.0," Dr Wade is the man! He is a very laid back old school doctor, where other doctors will prescribe you whatever costs the most Dr Wade is always willing to help you lower the cost of your medical bills. He offers practical advice on all general issues, and the best part is he speaks in a language that you understand. He is also excellent at accepting you on the spot, very few times have i been turned down for a last minute appoinment.  I'm 24 now and i've seen Dr Wade since i was 12 years old! ",1
3047,36395,1.0," This Dr. had been mine and my husbands eye Dr. for several years. This last encounter with him, was the last. It was a nightmare for my husband because his job entails a lot of computer work and he was examined by Dr. Wacasey and given a script. When it was filled, my husband couldn't see, everything was blurry and he got sick to his stomach and could'nt wear the glasses. Another trip back to the Dr. and another script, this one was wayyy different then the other and once filled, it was worse than the first. My husband asked for his records to be transfered to another Dr. and they did not do that. Dr. Wacasey came out into the waiting room and told my husband that no other Dr. could give him better care than him and to give him another try. No way. My husband can see fine now, using another Dr. I can't see how he is staying in business. He overbooks and there is no where to sit in his waiting room and he is always about an hour late on his appts. And his staff needs an attitude change.  ",-1

We have been going to Dr. Wadle a little over a year and I can honestly say I have never had such a caring and knowledgeable family doctor in my life.

3059,36408,1.0," The staff here are very rude. There are a few nice people here but that does not makeup for the rudeness of others. Wait time is very long. The doctor spends very little time with you. He spends more time in the hallways chatting with staff about personal issues then in the room with patients. The after hours service is nonexistent, which completely threw me off considering this is an OB office. The answers to everything is go to the ER, the doctors do not take after hours calls. I placed a call to a nurse about a medication they had me on and I never received a call back. Over 6 hours later I called the office back.then I was put on hold for over 5 minutes and when the nurse came on the phone she was very rude and told me the doctor doesn't work on Tuesday's and for me to go to the ER. The doctor said I couldn't have a midwife because I had fibroids, but I have never been diagnosed with fibroids. They treat you like a number and like your an inconvenience. Don't go here.  ",-1

3063,36408,1.0," I never once met Dr. Waddell throughout my entire 9 months of pregnancy.  He has a nurse practitioner who is basically the only person who handles the visits.  She acts as if each month she doesn't know you, She could never remember anything about my pregnancy, i.e.:  I measured 4 weeks larger than normal from 4 months on in my pregnancy and each month she walked in the room and said 'why are you measuring so big'.  She told me I would not have a 9 or 10 pound baby that it was the position my baby was in which is why I measured so large.  Well guess what I had a 10 pound 8 ounce baby via c-section.  I thought the nightmare was over but it was only beginning I began leaking @ my incision and was admitted to hosp.  Received home health daily to change dressing also had to have a wound vac.

Do not make my mistake go somewhere else nobody needs to be treated this badly by medical professionals.  Nurse alone is worthless but the lack of anything made us only sicker we have since been diagnosed with severe bronchisis but went to another clinc not clifton.

3080,36441,0.0," Dr. Wagman has been my Ob-gyn for approximately 5 years; she located tumor on left ovary, cyst on right, and referred me to endocronlogist for thyroid based on her physcial exam of me; all items not found by other docs.  I think Dr. Wagman and nursing staff is excellent.  ",1
3081,36441,0.0," The first post is rating her on stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with Dr. Wagman's abilities as a doctor(by the way, Dr. Wagman's office isn't responsible for resubmitting denied claims to the lab, that should be the lab's responsibility.Dr. Wagman doesn't own the lab or do billing for them. As the poster stated,her office DID take care of THEIR claim). Dr. Wagman is a very knowledgeable about her field. She is caring, respectful, and thorough. She delivered my daughter back in 2006 and I couldn't have asked for a better doctor.  I have recommended her to other people and all who have seen her agree.  ",1
3082,36441,0.0," Received a letter stating it was time for an annual exam, so I went in had an exam and was later billed by the lab and Dr. Wagman's office stating my insurance had expired. I received multiple different bills that were all different. After spending hours calling the insurance company, lab, and Dr. Wagman's office I finally inform the of their mistakes and they say they will fix it. Dr. Wagman's office quickly fixed their bill, but I continue to get bills from the lab. The insurance company tells me the doctor's office needs to resubmit the billing papers for the lab work. But when I talk to Dr. Wagman's office I continuously get the run around and have to deal with very rude and inpatient people who refuse to talk to me. They basically will deal with me until they find out their office already received their part of the money. Then they don't even bother fixing the lab fees that are incorrect. So I keep getting bills that I can't afford. Dr. Wagman is less than sympathetic. ",-1
3083,36443,0.0, My new baby ended up in NICU due to my concern that was brought to the attention of Dr. Wagners staff being treated as something that was normal &amp; not to be concerned about. NICU informed me if I would have waited for another week for my baby to be seen that my baby likley would have lost his life! Even before this incidence my 1st impression of Dr.  Wagnor &amp; the facility was that it was not very professional and I wish I would have walked away then and listened to my instincts! ,-1
3084,36443,0.0," Unfortunately, Dr. Wagner did not have much knowledge regarding our daughters illness which led to her hospitalization.  It was a simple illness and we caught it, but she was butting heads with us over it and refused to prescribe the necessary meds.  Thankfully Cooks agreed and saved her life.

At my appointed time I waited about half and hour in the waiting room but Wade was professional and paid attention to my explanation of symptoms while taking mine.  When she tested my back by pounding it with her fist, we were both shocked by my agonizing and unexpected scream. I think we were both shook up and she declared I had a kidney stone and prescribed 800mg tylenol for the pain.  4 days later my &quot;kidney stone&quot; turned out to be a kidney infection heading toward acute nefritis (vomiting, blood, high fever...gross) that landed me in the emergency room with a disgustingly high bill for a 4 hour visit.

Because I was going to have surgery, I was told before my appointment that I would be having lots of tests and that I would be there for about 2 hours.

3121,36523,1.0,"During an outpatient endoscopic Zenker diverticulectomy, Dr. Bentz noted in his Operative Report that the supplied surgical stapler was too large and blocked visualization of the surgical area. However, he elected to continue using the over-sized stapler anyhow. The next day I was readmitted through the ER to the ICU with a perforated esophagus. It took 19 days before my feeding tube and 24/7 antibiotic drip were removed. Dr. Bentz's treatment and bedside manners following the life-threatening incident were nearly as abhorrent as his mid-surgery decision making. I transferred my treatment to an out-of-state doctor at UCLA Medical Center, where I learned the source of my continuing problems was Dr. Bentz's failure to treat for reflux which should have been done preemptively because it is a common post-operative side effect of Zenker diverticulectomy surgery.

3123,36523,1.0,"I made a mistake seeing Dr. Bentz. Maybe in other situations he is an effective physician. During my visit he was rude and confrontational. He didn't want to take the time to answer my questions. Each time I brought up a valid concern, he brushed it off and threw out a one sentence answer. I felt I was wasting his time. At one point he rudely stated &quot;well, maybe it's cancer, I don't know&quot;. I don't doubt his medical expertise, I'm sure he's very knowledgable, however, I didn't appreciate the belittling and his brusk bedside manner. ",-1

They also will name your spouse for bad credit even if she has paid her dental bills. ",-1
3125,36525,0.0,"Dr. Baraldi is by a mile the most compassionate, patient and thorough doctor I''ve ever seen.  Her bedside manner is as good as they come and is matched by her expertise.  I refer her all the time to those I meet who are looking for a new doctor.  She has helped my family cope with our mother''s continually changing medical and life needs as she goes through a form of dementia.  She was also instrumental in diagnosing her rare illness (Pick''s disease) after we had seen several other doctors who could not pinpoint the exact nature of her decline.  She is kind, attentive and treats my mother with dignity and genuine care. ",1
3126,36526,1.0,I do not recommend Dr Bennett. I did not get the outcome I requested and expected. Also due to an infection I had to have additional surgeries. To fix what the infection caused I had to pay additional costs and I trusted Dr Bennett to make the best decision which it turned out he was wrong.  To fix the errors made was going to cost additional charges after I had aready paid $6000.00 which was outrageous.  If you have Dr Bennett perform surgery and you are not statisfied plan to pay more. ,-1
3127,36526,1.0,I had an excellent experience with Dr. Bennett and his staff. Highly recommended! ,1
3128,36526,1.0,"Dr. Bennett performed a rhinoplasty (nose job) and septum correction for me.  From my first consultation to my post-surgery checkups, he was highly professional, knowledgeable, punctual, and genial.

By far he as always done a 10+ job. Honestly I truly recommend everyone to go to him. Unfortunately it seems only bad experiences post any comments however you must remember that there are risks no matter what going in to cosmetic surgery, and some times those complications do happen. He takes care of all complications quickly and has never taken any risks with my health. ",1
3131,36528,1.0,"Dr Barnett did a breast lift and augmentation. I was very dissatisfied with the end result.  Even after a year, the implants were high and halfway in my armpit.  Dr Barnett redid them.  The result was no better.  We decided that I needed to go with bigger implants to get the look I wanted.  After the 3rd surgery, which I had to pay for partially because of the new implants, they are still not right.  Dr Barnett keeps trying to convince me he can improve the way I look, but i'm not ready for him to operate on me a 4th time.  What a nightmare and a waste of 4 years and countless visits.  Please, go to someone else. ",-1
3132,36529,1.0,He botched  operations on both my arms and now I have no feeling in my hands The operations were for carpal tunnel and should have been a piece of cake.Wouldn't recomend him to eneyone!! Loss the use of both hands and my way of making a living. ,-1

The only complaint I have is he will soon retire.   Then what will I do&#63;! ",1
3134,36529,1.0,"Dr. Bean has replaced both of my knees, and prior to the replacements, (LF in 04/RT in 09) I had multiple injections and scope surgeries. I have had so many visits with him over the past 8 years that he calls me his friend, and call him a friend as well. I would recommend Dr. Bean to anyone in need of Orth surgery. He is caring, he is compasionate, he is detailed, and when he is not sure about something, he will tell you straight up, yet at the same time keep pushing to find the answers. His staff is great! In fact I have only had one issue with anyone at all in all of Layton Tanner Clinic.  ALL staff is above average, and in Dr Beans office, they are great! ",1
3135,36529,1.0,I saw Dr. Bean after a broken collar bone. I went to see him every month for a year and a half. He told me at that point the bone had healed and that he could shave the large bump off that I had showing from the break. He did the surgery. The bump then started growing back and was not supposed to. Dr. Bean diagnosed me wrong. I went to anther Dr. The bone was a non-union and was not healed. That is why the bone grew back. I went through an unnecessary surgery. I went through the pain for nothing and wasted a lot of time. Dr. Bean's bedside manner was not good. He rushed in and out. I didn't have time to ever ask questions or find out what to expect. His front desk employees were also very rude. Not a good experience!! ,-1

3140,36533,1.0,"Dr. Beazer has been our family doctor for 8 years now and the office is the best in the Tooele County.  Wait time is very short and the staff is wonderful.  If one of my children comes home sick from school, I know they will work my child in that same day for an appointment. ",1
3141,36533,1.0,"If you like waiting for 45 minutes after your apt in the waiting room and then waiting another 45 minutes to an hour in the room, you'll love this doctor. Tried to give him the benefit of the doubt over 10 years and he hasn't improved one bit. Bed side manner is horrible and he truly does not care about his patients or their well-being. ",-1
3142,36533,1.0,"His staff is phenomenal! Its easy to get an appointment, if Beazer is not available then another doctor from the practice will step in, likewise if you are left waiting too long You Will Be Seen. All records are digital so its easy to make an appointment with anyone in the practice and know that they will have what they need to connect the dots and make the right call. The only problem I have ever had is having to get a second round of antibiotics, He completely knows his business.  ",1

Dr. Bench, I was told, had retired for a few years and then returned to work one day per week.  Technology had apparently left him behind and I had in hand and understood more tests and results than he could even find (could not operate the &quot;dang&quot; computer).  He even quoted me incorrect results from what he could find on the comnputer. He was not helpful nor professional.  I hate to be so negative but he should no longer be working in my opinion. One MRI report showed I had sacroiliitis and when I asked him about it he seemed embarassed, couldn't find it and when I showed it to him he said &quot;I dispute that.&quot; ",-1
3146,36534,1.0,"Worst experience I have ever had with a doctor. I was referred to him to determine if I had lupus. He did not listen to me, and ridiculed me in front of an intern he was training -- snickering, and telling me there was nothing wrong with me that we don't all have. I'm sure that at his age he has a few complaints, but I was barely forty. I went to another rheumatologist who did one simple test, found that my thyroid was under attack, prescribed a supplement, and my symtoms improved dramatically. I regret that I allowed my insurance to process a payment to Dr. Bench, because he did not provide the service that was billed. ",-1

3150,36535,1.0,"Dr. Bell is a great podiatrist! I would recommend him to anyone. He treated my husband and our son for in-grown toe nails and he did such a great job. Our son was but 12 months at the time, had a hard time learning to walk because of the pain from the in-grown toe nails so we were a little worried and apprehensive. Other doctors wanted to put him to sleep while they would work on him and others told us we would have to wait; we did not want to do that. Dr Bell was one and only who was willing to do a local anesthetic. He so gentle and he did a marvelous job working on him. Our son healed fast with no problems and was able to walk after that.  Even my husband (a wimp with needles and blood), who is also picky on who is allowed to touch his toes, thought Dr Bell was great and he would go back to him any time, if he had a need!Service was great, he is a very pleasant doctor and not rushed!

3152,36535,1.0,"Dr. Bell treated my husband for a rough spot on the bottom of his foot.  My husband is diabetic.  The doctor did not bio the cyst, only giving my husband instructions to soak his foot in vinegar and warm water.  My husband's foot became infected and the doctor did not check for what type of infection until after I personally went to an appointment with my husband and requested it be swabbed and sent to a lab.  When the results came back, the dcotor had to consult with the lab for treatment.  His treatment did not work.  After repeated visits where the doctor just kept making the wound deeper and wider, I finally called a wound care center and took my husband there.  The result was four months of care including having to have hyperbaric treatments and a cost to us of several thousand dollars plus the extra stress, etc. When we first went to the wound center, they thought his foot would have to be operated on and at least a toe removed.  We would not recommend this doctor.  ",-1
3153,36536,1.0,"Dr Benham likes to hear himself talk, and does not listen.  He does not display the compassion that I have experienced with the other ob/gyns that I have seen over the years; his bedside manner is poor.  His appts are booked every 15 minutes, so he does not spend much time with each patient; if an appt runs over, he quickly gets behind.  I waited nearly an hour to see him during one visit.  I will not return to him for future care, nor would I recommend him to others.  ",1

I had an appointment set, and called to confirm but it had disappeared off the books...I was looking at the card with the date and time on it. It took almost two weeks to have them fax a referral for me to get an ultrasound, even with me and the referral company calling. It took two weeks to refill blood pressure medicine, and then they renewed one  &amp; denied the other medicine and didn't bother to call me...I had been in the office within the last two months. The last time I was there I tried to make a follow-up appointment that Dr. Banks requested and the staff up front wouldn't even make an appointment for me. They said they would write a reminder for me to call in, but would not make the appointment. It's sad because Dr. Banks is such a great doctor, but if her staff doesn't follow her orders it useless for me to go there, so I moved our family records to another office that doesn't need babysitting.

Although she was, in the end, unable to help me (she recommended a psychiatrist for me to see) she was very good at asking questions and actually listening to my responses. She also did a thorough exam of me to be certain that I wasn't sick because of something physically wrong with me (blood test). For as long as I stay in the valley area, Dr Bank will be my doctor. She was great.  ",1
3159,36538,0.0,"We were pleased with Stacey's demeanor at the beginning, but let's face it, competency is number one, next to of course professionalism.  Issues began to surface after we started asking informative questions regarding vaccination.  We are not Jenny McCarthy crazy anti's--just want to know the potential consequences vs the benefits and primarily for determining a safer vaccination schedule for our little girl. At first, Stacey pretended to be vaccine neutral, telling us that she recommends full vaccinations, but that the decision is entirely up to the parents and that she would respect that decision. After reading literature she gave us, we chose to vaccinate, by spacing each administration. After the first vaccine, she became ill for three months. We simply wanted to know why she responded that way. Stacey became belligerant with my questions and promised to no longer see our girl if she was not fully vaccinated by a specific date. She refused to answer q's, so much for parents rights ",-1

3164,36539,1.0,"2 visits to this doctor and I realized I needed to run like hell. Should've ran after the 1st one, but thought I'd give him a 2nd chance.  At my 1st visit I was 34 weeks(just moved) and we talked a little about what I expected and what I was against. He did the routine measuring of my uterus and I didn't push my pants down far enough so he did it for me(really uncomfortable considering my last doctor would just go over my pants). At the second visit I was scheduled for my GBS test. He did this which was fine, but then with no warning at all, he did a vaginal exam(very uncomfortable, and it hurt really bad as well, I was still in pain from that the day after). He then told me my bishop's score, which he said was used to see if you would come b4 to your due date or on it. Not true, the bishop's score is used to see if you're able to be induced(which I am against unless medically needed; I told him that on my 1st visit). So he not only lied, but he also did a procedure that was not needed ",-1

However, if I had questions he always took the time to answer them and I trusted his opinion. Don't expect him to talk your ear off. I had to do my own home work to find out what questions I had as I think I should have. ",1
3166,36539,1.0,"Dr. Benedict has delivered 3 of my children including a twins. Dr. Benedict has vast experience, and is an excellent choice for someone with a high risk pregnancy. The only negative would be that if you want someone who is talkative, outgoing and will give you &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; you won't get that from him. He's straightforward, but will take time to answer your questions. Overall, he's a good doctor. ",1

Dr. Baugh has his assistant use a procedure of spraying water onto the injection site which causes a &quot;pressure feeling&quot;. By the time time you realize that there is a needle in there, it is over and there is no pain or stress. It also keeps that nasty taste out of your mouth. His staff are all competent and warm, friendly. They genuinely care about the patients. We have never had issues with our bill or scheduling.

3176,36543,1.0,Dr. Berry has amazing bedside manner and always makes me feel like he cares about my situation. I'm fine waiting in the waiting room if it means he's going to take his time with me and not be rushed to get to the the next patient.  ,1

I love that we can email him with questions and he will answer in less then 24 hours.  He is very busy, but never seems rushed during our visits.  We also really like his nurses, and the PA.  I know if I can't get in to see Dr. Berry, the PA will be very helpful.  I have had visits that have lasted more then 20 minutes because both Dr. Berry, and the PA take the time to answer all our questions in detail, until they know we understand. The ladies at the front desk are also kind, and helpful.  I have had alot of problems with the women in accounting.  We get bills that are for other people, and have even received a bill 10 months after a service and we thought it had been paid.  Although I think this reflects very little on Dr. Berry and his capabilities, it can be frustrating. ",1

His staff is good at relaying messages and Dr. Berry is good at returning calls. He's very concerned with getting you well and if he can't he sends you to a specialist. He really does have too many patients though. I was one of his first patients when he started practice and now it's hard to even see him. He's scheduled for like 2 weeks out at least.

Skip to the end: never went back, got treated by a real doctor.  Turns out all I needed was a lift in one shoe to even out my pelvis and relieve the pain.  He is NOT an M.D. He told me he was an osteopath. (D.O.) Doctor of osteopathy.

Dr. Bach assesses the alignment problem and adjusts me. He doesn't use &quot;hocus-pocus&quot; techniques, vitamins, or requires you to &quot;pay-services-forward&quot;.    I get adjusted and then a great massage from Devin, the massage therapist. Her deep massage is spectacular.     Would I recommend Bach Chiropractic--YES! ",1
3197,36548,1.0,I started seeing Dr. Bach because he's close to my house and accepts my insurance. I don't really like the extreme adjustments where one's head is grabbed and yanked to the side. Dr. Bach uses a hammer-like tool to firmly pound my vertebra instead. It's less stressful for me and seems to do the job.  ,1
3198,36549,1.0,"I wish he was more thourough. If you have a problem then he is but he never examines you otherwise.  His office is finally into this century and computerized. I don't like how they leave the doors of each room opened until the doctor comes in, you can see everybody else sitting in their rooms, no privacy, and the walls are paper thin you can hear everything in the other rooms.

3204,36550,1.0,Dr.Bankhead is just fantastic. I got two implants and two bone graft at his office in the past 12 months and I cannot ask for a better result. He and his staffs are very professional and caring. I'd recommend Dr.Bankhead to anyone who needs periodontal care. ,1
3205,36551,0.0,"Dr Bateman is a standout. She is highly intelligent and compassionate. She is truly dedicated to her patients and to the development of rational protocols for helping people afflicted with CFS/FMS. Because she spends an unusual amount of time in the initial evaluation and the subsequent treatment consults, compared to other practices, it limits the amount of monetary reimbursement she receives. I am sure Dr Bateman could recruit a more profitable clientele, however, despite her shoe-string budget, she remains devoted to her patients and to research that will benefit them. In a field where there are few answers and many questions, Dr Bateman manages to instill a sense of validation and optimism in each patient consult. For a patient that is willing to accept the unknowable about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia, there is no better partner in exploring the possible answers to his/her unique life/health experience.

She has no problem letting me go at a &quot;parental pace&quot; when it comes to immunizations. She interacts with all my children so well. She takes the time to really understand their issues and asks a plethora of questions to best determine their treatment. I've been so impressed and I will continue to go to her. Don't let that last post discourage you. She is a wonderful doctor and we will continue to go to her for many years to come! ,1
3214,36553,0.0,"My son was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus and we were told that there was really nothing to be done beyond giving him lots of fluids and OTC pain reliever for his fever.  I am pregnant; however, and when I called my OBGYN to let them know the situation they said he and I both needed to be on Tammiflu in order to keep me from getting a severe case.  When I called the doctor's office back about it, Dr. Berger said my son did not need Tammiflu since it was a virus and it wouldn't do much to help right now, plus the doses are limited.  When I insisted that my OBGYN recommended he be on it for my health I was told they would call me back.  They still have not.  Now, the only way I can see getting him on it is taking him to another doctor and getting the prescription after paying for yet another office visit.  I will not be going to Wee Care Pediatrics or to Dr. Berger again.  They were not helpful, and they seem less knowledgeable than my OBGYN. ",-1

Dr. Baar was recommended by a family member.  Her staff was able to fit us in same day.  We expected to get there and wait, but Dr. Baar was right on time.  She was very thorough and appropriately concerned.  And she requested that we call her if the kids didn't improve quickly.  That was quite a nice change!  We are very grateful to have found a doctor that we mesh well with. ",1

I didn't have pen ready to write a complex dosing schedule and I asked to have it repeated she was sarcastic.

3234,36557,1.0,"First, let me say that I don't have insurance, so when I went ER during vacation and saw Dr. Berg after suffering abdominal pain for 24 hours I was looking for an answer to my pain. A few previous painful episodes had me in the hospital a week or so earlier, and that doctor said I might have IBS. He gave me some drugs and pain meds and told me to come back if they didn't work. When I told this to Dr. Berg at the ER (my mistake) and he ran with it trying to link all my symptoms to IBS and did not do a full check for my condition. He gave me an x-ray, some blood work, and and IV. At the end when I asked for some pain meds or something to help with supposed IBS related pain which he diagnosed he refused to give them. After a week of more agonizing gut wrenching pain (without pain meds thanks to doctor Berg), I ended up back in the hospital with my original doctor who ran an ultrasound and a CT scan to find out I had to have my gallbladder removed immediately.

3235,36559,1.0,"Dr. Beall has helped me on three separate occasions with trauma I had faced in my life (car accident, childhood abuse, abusive marriage).  I can't thank him enough.  He is kind, intuitive, meditative, and hits the nail on the head every time.  He doesn't mess with therapies that don't work, but uses methods that do, and do quickly.  I highly recommend him if you have faced any sort of trauma.  I only regret that he only does trauma therapy now.  I could use his insight for other areas of my life...you know, a tune-up.  He is the best! ",1

He was on time or early for every appointment except one (Emergency C-Section -- and even then, his associate saw me within ten minutes of my appointment time).  He always had time for questions if I had any, but otherwise, I was in and out very quickly. I just finished my 6-week postpartum visit, and was home before the time the appointment was scheduled.  It means a lot to me when a doctor (and his nursing and reception staff) respect me enough not to waste my time. ",1
3239,36561,1.0,"When I told a few of my friends who I was going to see, they lit up and told me I would LOVE Dr.Baxter. And I did. I only had to wait for him once while he delivered a baby and it was only 20 mins. He always addressed my concerns and explained things in a way that made sense. I had A LOT of complications because I was so sick. He was there to check on me EVERYDAY-sometimes more- and the nurses all KNEW me and the situation and seemed VERY concerned about me.  Going to Dr Baxter was a blessing in disguise in so many ways. He found so many things wrong with me that other dr.'s wouldn't even consider checking. I felt like he TRULY cared about me as a person. The nurses in his office are just AMAZING!!! The only complaint we had was some of his front end office girls weren't that great to work with. But still, I recommend him to EVERYONE and won't go anywhere else! ",1
3240,36561,1.0,Dr. Baxter was extremely helpful and compassionate when i had a miscarriage and made me feel so much better after seeing him. He delivered my daughter as well and i thought he was great. The nurse had me push the baby til she was past my cervix&#63; and then Dr. Baxter came in to deliver the baby. He came back to check on me the next couple days and was so nice and friendly. His nurses at the office are awesome!

3242,36561,1.0,Good Dr very helpful during my pregnancy very punctual. Right on time for my delivery and helped me through hyperemmisis my who pregnancy. Only down side is broke my water before I really knew what was going on. Don't deliver at Orem nurses didn't catch Blood clot in my lung even though I complained the whole time of unbearable pain and shortness of breath.  I recommend him for non high risk normal pregnancys ,1
3243,36561,1.0,Dr. Baxter is a great doc.  Has been my doc for many years and is always very helpful and punctual.  I would recommend him to any women who wants a Dr. who practices great medicine. ,1
3244,36561,1.0,"Dr. Baxter was very punctual for pregnancy check-ups, which I loved!!  During those check-ups he kept things brief, but was always willing to answer any questions I had.  If I were rating him on check-ups, he'd get 5 stars--awesome.  The delivery though. . . awful.  I was induced, which was fine, but when he came in to check on me, he broke my water before I knew what was going on, while my husband was across the room on the phone--I was so bewildered by what was happening, and hated that he didn't even ask if that was okay.  Then I mostly delivered my baby with a nurse present, and he barely made it in by the very end.  I felt that his priority was punctuality/moving things along quickly as opposed to taking into consideration the feelings/desires of the patient.  My sister-in-law had a c-section with him and had nothing but good things to say about him, but for vaginal births, I'd recommend someone else.  ",-1
3245,36561,1.0,"Dr. Baxter is very respectful and nice. He is busy it seems, but never to the point where I feel slighted. He has always given me whatever information I need and does a great job. Me, a couple of my friends and family members all use him and we all feel the same, he is great. ",1
3246,36561,1.0,"Showed up at the last minute (literally) for my delivery.  The nurse kept trying to find him, but couldn't.  I had to stop pushing and wait through several contractions so the baby didn't come while he wasn't there.  During the delivery and while he was stitching me up, he didn't explain anything he was doing and then the next day forgot to check me as he made his rounds at the hospital.  His partner did it later that night. ",-1
3247,36561,1.0,"I had a baby with a serous problem that was not caught before delivery. At the end of my pregnancy Dr. Baxter keep ask me when I was due, and I keep think to myself I don't know your the doctor. I was measuring bigger then I should have been and Dr. Baxter didn't bother to order an ultrasound. Had he order another ultrasound the problem could have been caught and maybe my baby could have lived. Dr Baxter also didn't bother to look at my hips and due to how small I am the baby got caught in my hips. It was a horrible delivery on top of all the other problems this baby had, she also had cerebral palsy. I was full term 35 weeks and 5 days, so almost 36 weeks. I never got a call for Dr. Baxter after the baby passed away.  I did however have the baby on a Wednesday, and she passed away on Thursday, and his office called on Friday to confirm my appointment for Monday.  What horrible communication skills he must have with his office staff. I would never recommend this doctor. ",-1
3248,36561,1.0,"I''ve heard a few comments from others about Dr. Baxter that imply they don''t like him.  I think mostly because he is an in and out kind of doctor... I have always found that he answers my questions appropriately and makes sure everything is going well at my appointments.  I NEVER have had to wait long which is a major plus.  I don''t know what kind of relationship people expaect to have with their OB, but he is great, fast but personable, friendly and nice.  I would recommend him to friends. ",1
3249,36561,1.0,"Dr. Baxter is a nice person.  He did a great job treating me in my teens for problems I had.  He did a great job with fertility issues I had when trying to become pregnant.  However he was very unsupportive of my wanting a natural/drug free childbirth.  (I'm not one of those fanatic freaks,  I just wanted to do it without drugs.)  He told me I would not be able to do it, that I would fail and ask for an epidural.  In my last appointment before having my child he stripped my membranes without asking me or telling me.  I bled a lot.  It hurt like crazy but it was my first child and I didn't know what he was doing.  He broke my water in the hospital without asking/telling me.  (We had talked earlier about not breaking my water.) I did go on to have a natural birth.  He showed up as I was pushing. If you aren't bothered by a doctor not talking to you about what they're doing then he's great for you.   For me he was a great Gyno, (he is also good at being on time), but NOT a good OB.  ",-1
3250,36561,1.0,"Great Doctor! Very Professional and Competent. Staff is punctual and helpful, as well. He doesn't talk a lot, which suits me just fine, but ever time I've had a question he is more than happy to answer it for me. ",1
3251,36561,1.0,"I agree, he is almost always on time! He talks kind of fast which I sometimes misinterpreted as trying to hurry me. But really, he doesn't hurry you at all. Just ask him any question you want and he's glad to help! ",1
3252,36561,1.0,If you want a punctual Dr he is the one for you! I never waited more than 5 min (as opposed to his Partner Dr. Young who always seemed to be running late). I was grateful he found immediatly that my baby turned breech. We discussed our options and I chose to have a c-section. He is very good at them! I hear he dosen't like to be called till the last second on vaginal births though. And he only delivers at OCH and Timp--which is bad if your baby has to be shipped to a NICU like my baby did. (I'm switching Dr.s for that very reason...and he dosen't do VBACS either).  But he's a great Dr and very pronto! ,1
3253,36561,1.0,"Dr. Baxter is a great doctor! He listens and addresses all concerns brought to his attention. He's a bit quirky in his mannerisms but only because he wants to make sure you understand what he is suggesting. He has great confidence in his recommendations. He covers all the bases and makes sure that all appropriate tests are run before a prescription or surgery is recommended. Dr. Baxter knows WHO he is talking to before he comes into the examination room (meaning, he will read your medical records to refresh his memory about your case before he enters, which is unlike some doctors who cannot remember your name, much less your ailment). He is also willing to refer you to someone else if he thinks that they would be better equipped to address a medical issue. Also, the assistants and nurses in Dr. Baxter's office are very helpful and compassionate. ",1
3254,36562,1.0,"My son is a patient of his, we really like him he is easy to talk to and listens well. My son really likes him. But it took a long time for him to come into the room, about an hour. ",1

Dr. Beals not only put me at ease and made me feel extremely comfortable about the procedure. He is very confident and that makes you feel confident about what he is doing. And he is amazing at explaining things in a way you understand. And that's another thing: he actually takes the time to explain things to you. He is very often running behind schedule, but that is something I quickly got used to because once you are in the exam room with him, you have his full attention and he will not leave until all your questions have been answered. And he goes above and beyond. To this day if I send him an email, he will make sure to send me a reply even if it's only a word or two. Oh yeah...and he totally fixed my problem.  My ankles are perfection now! ",1

It turned out that my diverticulitis had become acute and I had to have surgery to remove the severly infected parts of my colon.  I was so used to the pain of diverticulitis over the last 6 years, that I ignored it.  Had it not been for Dr Barton's insistance, I might not have been around to tell this story.       Dr Barton is an excellent physician and a very caring person.  I would never go to anyone else! ",1

3272,36567,1.0,"Extremely dissatisfied.  Did not focus on my symptoms and instead told me simply to lose weight using his wife's diet program.  I felt very dismissed, and he never followed up with my lab results.  When I called to request them they said there would be a $40 fee.  The receptionist was nice enough, and actually did tell me I could get the results for free online.  I am searching for a new endocrinologist that takes me seriously and actually follows through. ",-1
3273,36567,1.0,"I saw Dr. Benowitz despite the bad reviews here, as the reviews dwelled on staff and billing problems, not his knowledge or expertise in the field of endocrinology. I found him to be extremely helpful, he spent quite a bit of time with me taking my history, my extended family's history, and evaluating me. I have more than one auto-immune disorder and he was well versed in them all, even going so far as to test me for one I hadn't even heard of, based on my previous labs and symptoms. I would recommend Dr. Benowitz. It's my opinion that there is often a price to pay for any good doctor and it's usually an office receptionist or billing department that falls short. He came highly recommended by other endo's and I agree that he's a great doctor. ",1
3274,36567,1.0,"Comment one of this page, is so true!!  What a joke of a doctor and expensive!  After 1 hour wait and a two minute consulation, all for a $533.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS DOCTOR!!! ",-1
3275,36567,1.0,The worst experience with a Doctor so far. Said they accepted our insurance and took our card.  When it was found the billing/receptionist lied or was misinformed they.   a. Would not call us back b. Did not return phone messages c. Will not work with us because of their mistake but made huge collections threats. d. Billed us for labs that were actually paid for by our insurance but won't take them off their bill. d. Are extremely rude and unprofessional e. Didn't actually even give us our labs.   We ended up going to Dr. Brady who would accept our insurance for the same service.  He billed our insurance about 1/3 the cost that Benowitz had billed us.  Benowitz assertions to us were completely contradicted and backed up with examples.   I'd avoid this guy like a disease.  He does have a militant cancellation policy too. ,-1
3276,36567,1.0,The doctor's &quot;48 hour notice of cancellation&quot; policy excludes holidays and weekends. I was notified less than 48 hours from my appointment that this was the doctor's policy. The short story is I had to obtain legal cousel to fight charges of about $350.00. I'd stay away from this guy - you'd have a tough time finding a less compassionate doctor. ,-1

Per my request, after surgery he brought my tonsils to me so I could see them. I asked several questions about them and he answered them wonderfully. I knew the recovery would be long and painful, but he did his best to make it better. I had great access to either him or his partners after hours, and I used it several times. He is friendly and cares about you. My recovery was painful, but it was doable. He also took my 12 year old daughter's tonsils and adenoids out a few weeks after he did mine. My daughter had complications in her recovery, throwing up and difficulty hydrating. She ended up needing I.V. fluids twice. It wasn't fun.

I was extremely irritated that she didn't suggest reducing my dosage to see if the side effects would diminish.    Another annoying fact is that you only really get to see the doctor ONCE!

We have paid very close attention to how accurate his assistants are when calling in new prescriptions and re-fills. They have been wrong seven out of ten times, either with the dosage, number of pills, size, and whether generic or name-brand.

When I called Ashley at the front desk she was very empathetic and offered a refund or to keep the deposit to lock in pricing.  I decided that they could keep the deposit, because I will be having the surgery in the future and there is no one else I would consider for surgery.

When questioned about the CT scan he said that would be a good idea to look at the x-rays together and he would get them. After another long wait he returned stating he had not seen the films but would schedule surgery. Why advise me to come for a follow up visit indicating he had seen the films when he had not.

3360,36588,0.0,"Delivered my first baby and was my dr for part of my second pregnancy.  She retired part way through and didn't tell me that I'd have to have a different Dr. deliver.  I was very disappointed.  She was very good and reassuring, but SUPER busy.  The wait was at least an hour for every appointment and she spent a very few rushed minutes with me.  ",1
3361,36588,0.0,"Dr. Beard is an excellent doctor, however she is extremely busy and I always felt rushed. Her nurses are great, however. What I really didn't like about her was that she induces regularly (I'm assuming to keep a schedule). I did not want to be induced without a medical reason, however I was pressured into being induced 3 days before my due date. Because of this, I will be selecting a different doctor for my next pregnancy, but if you would like to be induced (or don't mind it), then she'd be fine. Be prepared to wait. I didn't even get to meet with her until I was over 20 weeks along (I saw the nurse practitioner instead).  ",1
3362,36588,0.0,She is absolutely the best in her field in every way. The problem is that it is hard to get an appointment with her. ,1
3363,36588,0.0,"I've been seeing Dr Mary Beard for 15 + years (I'm only 30) i have recommeded her to a lot of others and they've all been happy. She's a very busy women so expect to wait (punctual&#63; no so much) but I would and do give up a day just to see her. I now live 6 hours away and still make a trip at least once a year. On my last pregnancy I travel 6 hours each month and then stayed in SLC, UT the last month just so she'd be the one to deliver my baby. She's the best ",1
3364,36589,1.0,"When I found out I was pregnant Dr. Barney was recommended to me by my regular gyno. At first I was very pleased with him, but at 24 weeks I was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia and had to be admitted to the hospital. I was at Jordan Valley under Dr. Barney's care for two days and I ended up hating him! I agree with the previous comments about him seeming tired, like every second he had to spend with me was a waste of his time. He knew in my condition I would be lucky if my baby made it, and he just stopped caring. Luckily, I was transfered to another hospital where I was taken excellent care of. Unfortunately, my son was born at 25 weeks and only lived for 8 days. After talking to several different doctors I have been told that Dr. Barney should have known that the symptoms I was having were signs of preeclampsia and helped me sooner! If he had, my son might be here today... He may just be busy, but thats a big mistake to make... Good luck to any one that continues to see him...  ",-1
3365,36589,1.0,"Loved Dr. Barney, he did my C-section. And i was so scared, this being my first baby, but he did a great job and is staff was amazing. ",1
3366,36589,1.0,"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely adore Dr. Barney and his staff and am actually a bit surprised to find any negative comments about him.  When I found Dr. Barney, I had been on a hunt to find &quot;the&quot; right doctor, someone to take care of me through a future planned pregnancy, all the way through menopause and beyond. :)  Anyone I had seen for my annuals had been ok, but not really what I was looking for, until I went to him.  I think he has excellent bedside manner and medical knowledge.  He ALWAYS took the time to listen to me and any concerns.  He takes his time with each patient, as your health and your babies health are more important to him rather then getting patients in and out.  He delivered my baby girl and I will keep going to him until he decides to retire one day.  Considering the time and care he puts in to each patient, the time you put in in the waiting room is nothing.  Oh, and he's quite comical too!  :)  The staff is very sweet.  ",1
3367,36589,1.0,"Dr Barney is an amazing OBGYN.  He is caring, professional, and very knowledgeable. He has seen me through 4 complicated pregnancies, during which Dr. Barney performed three successful cervical cerlage surgeries, and discovered that I had a tumor in my thyroid that was Papillary Cancer. Because of his thorough care and examination during my prenatal visits, I was lucky to have the cancer found, in what other OB’s don’t typically examine.     He always listened to my concerns and always made me feel comfortable. During all my deliveries, Dr Barney was extremely professional, and I always had a very positive experience. He made efforts to be to each delivery, which was important to me. I have always healed very well, and I know it is because of his skills    Even though you might wait a while to see him, he is worth the wait. He is a little reserved when you first meet him, but very kind, personal, and professional.  ",1
3368,36589,1.0,"Dr Barney has cared for me and my family members for several years. He always takes the time to be sure I understand and answer any of my questions. There have been occasions where I have waited longer than I would have liked, but I figure you should be worried about a doctor that doesn't have any patients or any babies to deliver. He cared for me during 4 very difficult pregnancies (due to preterm labor and toxemia). I really believe he saved my life and the life of my baby.  Thank you Dr. Barney!! ",1
3369,36589,1.0,"Here is Dr. Barney in a nutshell: dishonest, and has no regard for your long term well being. I would never ever recommend him to anyone. ",-1
3370,36589,1.0,I really like Dr Barney. I agree that he sometimes does seem a bit tired but I ALWAYS feel like he has mine and my baby's best interest in mind. He is patient with any questions you have and is really laid back and makes you feel comfortable with him. I would refer him to anyone! ,1
3371,36589,1.0,Worse Doctor I have ever been to. Not to mention he seemed either very tired or **** once he came in.  His bedside manner is terrible and I would not trust him nor recommend him to anyone! ,-1
3372,36589,1.0,"After having a terrible birthing experience with my 2nd child, I changed to Dr. Barney. He made the birth of my 3rd child a wonderful experience. He noticed potential problems and kept me from having a C-section. Although the wait times can be long, Dr. Barney is always willing to thoroughly answer every question I have. I find if I take one of the first appointments of the day I don't wait long at all. I definitely recommend Dr.  Barney! ",1
3373,36589,1.0,"I had two of my children with Dr. Barney.  He is a very knowledgable doctor and has a great nurse.  Unfortunately, I always had long waits for appts. and I felt he was condescending.  After giving him a second chance with my second child and still feeling the same, I changed Dr.'s.  I love my new Dr. who is personable, knowledgeable and always prompt with appts.  So if you are only worried about medical knowledge and don't care about any of the other factors, Dr. Barney would be a good option for you.  If you do care about the other factors, you may want to keep looking. ",1
3374,36589,1.0,"Dr. Barney has delivered my last two babies and I can say with confidence that I feel well taken care of by him and his office staff.  He always put my best interests at heart, even when I requested things that weren't the status quo.  He is very competent and knowledgeable.  I know the wait was occasionally long, but that's just a part of an OB/GYN office.  He has to leave to deliver babies occasionally and I understand that.  ",1
3375,36589,1.0,"Save yourself a lot of time and go to a doctor that will actuall show up to your appointment within 20 minutes of your arrival instead of 2 hours!  I had 2 babies with this doctor, and I can't believe the time I wasted waiting for him at each appt.  He never apologized either.  It was ridiculous.  Not to mention he didn't deliver either of my kids.  I finally got a clue and switched on my last baby, and couldn't be happier.  Go to Christian Froerer at Cottonwood OBGYN!  You won't be sorry! ",1
3376,36589,1.0,"I just had a baby with Dr. Barney and he did such an amazing job!  He takes time during your appointments and his nurse, Sandy, is the best nurse I have ever met.  He did such a great job during my actual labor and delivery too and it was partially due to his great experience and advice that I didn't tear at all. I will be having all my kids with Dr.  Barney! ",1
3377,36589,1.0,"I love Dr. Barney, he's an excellent OB and I love his staff. I've delivered my twins with him & will be having this baby with him too, he also delivered my little brother! So we know him quiet well.  ",1
3378,36589,1.0,He is an excellent doctor and I felt that he was trustworthy. ,1
3379,36589,1.0,He's very helpful but very busy. I love his nurses Deanna and Sandi. They really are sweet.  ,1
3380,36590,1.0,Dr. Bean is so nice and very helpful he made me feel very relaxed and when I went in to labor I had some complications. He walked me through them and then when the time came to have our son he actually remembered me. Love working with him ,1
3381,36590,1.0,"Dr. Bean is the absolute best!  This is a VERY busy practice and Dr. Bean always takes the time to listen to all of your concerns.  I was pregnant with twins and he would patiently answer my laundry list of questions at each appointment.  Because of this, he does run behind on occasion, but for me, the care and attention I felt was more important than being on time each appointment.  He is always in a good mood and I appreciate his humor.  If you are looking for a doctor, Dr. Bean is an EXCELLENT choice.  ",1
3382,36590,1.0,"What can I say about Dr Bean!&#63; He is a dang good doctor! He delivered my baby and he was very helpful during labor and delivery. He kept telling me to just relax and breathe. I ended up having an easy delivery, because of his encouragement. He is a very smart Doctor, he really knows what he's doing. I agree with everyone else... He really does care about his patients. Every time I had an appointment with him he would always ask me if I was happy. He really does care about how your feeling and he wants you to be happy. He is the most caring Doctor I have ever known. I also think he's hilarious, he always makes me laugh. I can't ever picture him being grumpy.. He is always so happy! I could go on forever about Dr. Bean! All I have to say is that he is incredible! ",1
3383,36590,1.0,"Dr. Bean is my favorite doctor at that office.  He made me feel like he actually cared about me and my baby, and that I wasn't just another patient.  At one point before I delivered, he asked what we were thinking we would name our son, and he remembered the name at my six week appointment!  Plus he has a great sense of humor; when my son was born and I heard him cry for the first time, I started crying really hard (I couldn't help myself, it was amazing!) and Dr. Bean said, &quot;Why are you crying&#63;  Do you want me to put him back&#63;&quot;  Overall Dr. Bean is amazing.  He cares about his patients, and doesn't judge you if you are ignorant about something (which I was about a lot of things since this was my first).  He is very knowledgeable and very helpful, and puts you at ease.  I felt that I could trust him completely with my health and that of my baby.   I hope he delivers all of my future babies! ",1
3384,36590,1.0,"This doctor was very calm and soothing as well as upbeat and even cracked a few appropriate jokes.  He keeps smiling, which is a plus.  He delivered my baby easily - it was the easiest birth of my three so far.  He helped me slow down and take it easy pushing so I didn't tear at all and I only pushed for 15 minutes (it was probably about 5 minutes of actual pushing within that amount of time)!  It went so smoothly and he was very encouraging! ",1
3385,36590,1.0,I have never felt more comfortable with a doctor.  He really cares and LISTENS to his patients.  With some of the other doctors in the office I felt like they would condescend my opinions.  They had the medical degree and my gut feelings were not important.  Bean took everything I said as fact and he ended up being right on more than one occasion.  He induced me and he decided to do a C-Section that another doctor said it was not necessary.  Both decisions ended up to be very necessary and they saved the life of my son.  He has a patient for life. ,1
3386,36590,1.0,"Dr. Bean is wonderful! Out of the 5 doctors in that practice, he is by far my favorite! He is very considerate, down to earth, and has the best personality ever! He is always in a good mood, which always puts me in a better mood. He treats you like you are his only patient. He delivered my baby a few months ago and he was very encouraging through out my labor, which helped me have a better delivery. I always looked forward to visits with him. He takes his time to listen to what you have to say to him. I hope that he will be able to deliver more of my babies in the future. I totally recommend him!(I do like the other doctors as well, but I like Dr. Bean the best!) ",1
3387,36590,1.0,"Dr. Bean is a fantastic OB/GYN. I had a complicated pregnancy involving hospital bed rest and the premature delivery of our baby at 27.5 weeks.  All of the docs in the group were very knowledgeable and helpful, but Dr. Bean has the best bedside manner by far. I ALWAYS felt like he was sincerely listening and patiently answered my questions. He never made me feel like he was in a hurry to get out. Yes, I had to wait a while to see him in the office but considering the time and care he takes with his patients, I felt it was worth it. When the time came to talk contraceptives, I waited until he was making rounds because I knew he would take the most time with me to talk through all the options.  He was also very comforting and sensitive to my emotional concerns.  Thank you, Dr. Bean and everyone at Valley OB/GYN for taking such great care of me.  ",1
3388,36591,1.0,"Been to Dr. Bane three times over a couple of years. He has yet to check me for anything. Seems he mostly does &quot;interviews-only&quot; appointments. Asks questions then prescribes the medications following blood-work. He's getting old and I believe his mind is elsewhere thinking of places he'd rather be and things he'd rather be doing. Nice staff, but not very thorough.  ",-1
3389,36592,1.0,"Dr. Bedell is a friendly, kind doctor who really cares about his patients' pain. He is also knowledgeable about the field. The only one huge problem he has --and maybe it's something he can't avoid, I don't know-- is that once the staff puts you in the examination room to wait for him, he takes well over an hour sometimes! I have never had to wait that long for a doctor. I thought I was going to pass out from anxiety last time! ",1
3390,36592,1.0,"I was one of Dr. Bedell's first patients when he came to Cache Valley (Logan area) in 1996 or 97. I didn't mind waiting a bit for him, because I knew I would get his undivided attention when my turn came. He is the most compassionate and knowledgable Dr ever, about pain control. He has many different devices in his office to try to make the pain go away, and also deals with prescriptions when I could not even get a Tylenol 3 for my severe chronic pain for 20 years. Utah Doctors are absolutely paranoid to help anyone who is not. He truly saved my life. My heart was stopping when the pain got too much, and with his care, that problem was taken care of. He was truly like a gift from God after years of torture and neglect from other doctors. He knows that people in severe pain are not drug seekers, they are pain-relief seekers!He knows that it's rare for a pain paitent to get addicted, but they can get dependent, and he's a rare Dr. that knows the difference between the two.  ",1
3391,36592,1.0,"If there is anyone better than Dr. Bedell, I haven't met him/her.  His assistant, Jeanette, is a wise, warm, wonderful, caring, knowledgable woman.  I've had chronic pain now for over 12 years and have the medical records to authenticate my case.  Since the laws governing prescribing pain meds have become tighter, Dr. Bedell was my last hope.  I've been a patient there now for almost a year and wouldn't think of changing.  ",1

MORE THAN A 5 STAR RATINg!!! HE HAS BEEN MY PRIMARY CARE DOC FOR 11 YEARS..  SO I KNOW AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IVE SENT TO HIM ARE SO THANKFUL!!! GOOD LUCK! ZOWIE ",1
3393,36592,1.0,"The most amazing doctor I have ever been to. He talked to me for 3 hrs about what I was going through with my chronic pain and why doctors are not willing to help me. He is very strict about providing pain medicine, but understands that for some people it is the difference between leading somewhat of a normal life or not living at all. If you have pain, there is no other doctor I would waste my time with. ",1

3435,36608,0.0,"She is very cold. She doesn't understand working, middle-class people.  She told my son that if he had to quit his job in order to rest and get well, that is what he would have to do.  Maybe she will get sick and someone will tell her to quit her job.  ",-1
3436,36608,0.0,She has you on a time clock and will only discuss one medical issue/concern per appointment. As a family practice doctor I would think she would be open to treating the entire person not one thing at a time with repeat appointments required. She wouldn't follow up with a phone question about a topic at a recent doctors visit but asks for another face to face appointment. ,-1
3437,36609,1.0,"Dr. Beckstead is by far THE best doctor I have ever seen.  He helped me through a very difficult time.  I was so sad when I left Utah - If I were able, I'd still make trips back so that I could be under his care.  This is one person who went into the medical field for the right reasons.  If he doesn't know the answer, he'll tell you he doesn't and he will look until he finds it.  He literally saved my life.  He cares about his patients and is willing to see you immediately if you're having a problem.  I'd recommend Dr. Beckstead to any nice person, because I believe that a kind doctor deserves kind patients. ",1
3438,36609,1.0,I went to Dr. Beckstead when he was still in Provo as a resident doctor at Utah Valley Family Practice.  He was my doctor with two of my pregnancies.  He was so good through my whole pregnancy and especially during labor and delivery that I named my son after him.  His name is Kael Scott.  I was so sad when he left to move up to Bountiful.  It I didn't live in Payson I would continue going to him forever.  He is the best doctor.  He really cares unlike some others I have been to that just treat you like a number instead of a person.  If you live in the Bountiful area and need a good doctor he would be the one. ,1
3439,36610,1.0,"Hi is an amazing Dr. He showed concern for my pain and was quick to ease my pain. Very knowledgeable, friendly, humorous, his staff is the best there is. Would recommend this office to all my friends and family. ",1
3440,36610,1.0,"Diagnosed and treated my problem.  Am now doing great.  Back to full activity.  He is very nice, approachable, takes his time and knows his stuff.  Very pleased!  Highly recommend.  ",1
3441,36610,1.0,"From the first visit, his first concern was to find the true cause of the leg pain in my daughter (which is exactly what we wanted).  She is slowly getting her leg back to where she can participate in her sport; however, Dr. Betteridge has been nothing but knowledgable, professional and very personable in her care.  He called our home with her blood test results twice, that sure says a lot about him! I would highly recommend him to anyone needing sports medicine care. ",1
3442,36610,1.0,Very knowledgable and helpful.  My shoulder is better and I am back to work.  Would recommend highly.  ,1
3443,36611,1.0,"This dentist is great! I have been seeing Dr Baird for 9 years. I have had 2 crowns and 2 root canals done by Dr Baird. Both have turned out fine with no problems at all. He is always been conservative with his treatment and continues to update his dental practice with the newest technology. I had a problem with one procedure, his staff got me in immediately and Dr Baird took care of it at no charge. Great dentist!! I refer all my friends here and they all love him and have never had a problem! ",1
3444,36611,1.0,"I have seen Dr. Baird for 9 years, he has done 4 crowns on my molars(at $800.00 + a piece). On two of them he drilled so poorly that he cracked the roots. AFTER I suffered with excruciating pain and the new crowns were on, he told me the teeth were too infected to save and the only thing that can be done is to pull them. So $1600.00 down the drain. Only recently have I found out they could have been SAVED BY SENDING ME TO AN ENDONTIST! The next 2 molar crowns he made these new cerec crowns. He never asked me what material I wanted and I was shocked to find that they had been done. Both have fallen apart one of them twice in only three years! I went to another dentist who repaired the root canal and ordered a crown from a lab. The work done by Baird on this root canal was so bad a rod had disintegrated and had to be redone. After only 3 years! Aside from this several fillings he filled have cracked or fallen out. STUPID must be branded on my forehead. Save your $ see someone else. ",-1
3445,36611,1.0,"This 'dentist' is the worst.  If he hadn't such a nice staff, I would have given him all zeros! Save your smile for a different dentist.  UGH!!! ",-1

3447,36612,2.0,"Very knowledgeable, extremely helpful and made two hip replacements for my wife with excellent reslts. ",1
3448,36613,1.0,"Had to wait in the waiting room for quite a while on my first visit.  But that must have been a bad day because on my subsequent visits, I was seen right away.  Dr Baranko is fixing my shoulder in about a week.  But already I'm super impressed.  One thing I really liked is that he didn't try pressure me into surgery.  He took the time to give me as much information as he could so I could make an informed decision.  He(and his staff) were very friendly.  He was very knowledgeable and great at explaining things to me so I could understand.  I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of an orthopedic surgeon.  ",1
3449,36613,1.0,Dr. Baranko was very thorough. Excellent at answering questions but also at explaining any procedure he performed in examination and through surgery. He has a great bedside manner and was very concerned for my comfort and care.  ,1
3450,36613,1.0,"Wow, I cant even believe we are talking about the same Dr. My mom was in a horrible motorcycle accident, broke her hip in 3 places and her femur in 4 places, although surgery was longer then anticipated it was only because of how bad the actual injury ended up being once he opened her up and could see it first hand. Dr. Baranko was more then amazing throughout every step of my mothers care. She is from Texas and was only visiting when the accident occured and even still he is very concerned and helpful. She came back to Utah over the Christmas holiday and made an appointment just as a follow up, he was very thorogh and very professional. Our overall experience with him has been nothing short of amazing. He has cared for not only my mom but also my aunt and myself.. due to all of our experiences with him we would not want to go to anyone else and I would definatly reccomend him.  ",1
3451,36613,1.0,"Dr Baranko did my son's femur surgery and as far as I can tell he did a great job. He was professional and courteous. Not overly warm or friendly, more like all business. But the surgery went great, he was good about keeping us up to date, and did a great job explaining what was going to happen and what to expect in the future. ",1
3452,36613,1.0,The friendly staff could not tempt me to remain in the examination room beyond 2 hours after my scheduled appointment.  A medical assistant checked on me once with an apology for the long wait.  I appreciated the apology; however an excuse or reason with an accurate estimate of remaining wait time would have been better.  I left before the physician assistant could examine me - happy only that my medical need wasn't urgent and that there were other clinics available to choose from.  ,-1
3453,36613,1.0,Doesn't care about patient pain. Acts as if people are cattle. Has to be pushed by patient to get good answers and tests.  ,-1

3455,36614,1.0,About a month ago my father was hospitalized. He was diagnosed with renal disease. Dr barklow saved he's life. ,1
3456,36614,1.0,18 months ago my husband was in the hospital for 19 days due to sepsis and then kidney failure. Dr. Barklow was very helpful and informative. He took time to explain everything. My husband has been visiting him regularly since then and his care has remained consistently excellent. I highly recommend Dr. Barklow to anyone.  ,1
3457,36614,1.0,"Excellant care and extremely nice. Takes time to answer questions, never feel rushed. When in hospital always took time with me and helped me through my procedures with repect and caring. Would also recommend other doctors in the office.  ",1
3458,36615,1.0,"I've went through a dozen pediatricians looking for a good one and never felt like a single one actually cared about our kids until we visited Dr. Bartholomew.  He is the BEST.  So nice, he cares about you and your kids, knows what he is doing and is great at treating the symptoms as well as caring for the patient. We won't be switching pediatricians as long as he is in practice.  ",1
3459,36616,1.0,Dr. Barton is amazing.  He is a kind and genuine person who has helped us deal with 3 miscarriages.  He knows me and speaks to me like a friend.  He is more caring than I could have asked for.  I recommend him to all of my friends. ,1
3460,36616,1.0,I Absolutely LOVE Dr.Barton. He not only has a good relationship with me as a patient but also with my husband. I feel as though he saved my daughter life. When she was born the umbilical  cord was tightly wrapped around her neck 7 times. With his quick thinking and calm attitude he saved her and never made me or my husband worry. I also had a major ovarian cyst that he was very quick to help me take care of. He always seems to be very conservative and I like that a lot. ,1
3461,36616,1.0,He told me I had Endo and PCOS. He then didn't explain them to me and told me to look up my problems online. He is only a good doctor when it is work with no complications. Other then that he couldn't care less and can't even explain anything. I wonder how he would feel if a doctor told him he had a horrible condition and then told him to go look it up online. In my opinion he shouldn't be practicing if he doesn't care to tell someone what is happening to them. ,-1
3462,36616,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Barton for over 2 years.  We have been trying to get pregnant for the longest time and Dr. Barton could care less.  He always gives contradicting advice every time I go.  The last time I went to see him was a follow up visit for a procedure I had.  He had know idea how to read the results from the procedure and even asked me if I have had kids before!  What a joke.  Every time I go I tell him how hard I've tried to get pregnant for the first time.  I then told him I was 30 and he told me that I am young and should be patient,  I am not going back. ",-1
3463,36616,1.0,"I hate him the wait was always long, His staff was rude to me, my health problems were misdiagnosed I suffered in pain for a year and a half I would tell him or his staff something was wrong and they always said it was something else he wouldn't do anything to help me.  I changed doctors and got the help I needed.  I won't go back. ",-1
3464,36616,1.0,"I had a very horrible labor experience with this doctor. He was six hours late for my c-section, I was in labor for 24 hrs. The staff did not give me the appropriate antibiotics and my baby was infected with strep-b. She was in the hospital for a month and needed three surgeries. I feel Dr. Barton is resposible for my daughters illness. He has too many patients to take care of and does not take the time to make certain everything is how it should be.  ",-1
3465,36616,1.0,"I LOVE this doctor. Followed exactly what I wanted in labor and delivery. Very personal knows who you are remembers almost everything about you. Brings up pleasant conversation.  Short wait, always there when you need him! ",1
3466,36616,1.0,Dr. Barton Was amazing. He took the time to include my husband in every part of my pregnancy. I am so lucky to have found such an amazing doctor through the referal of my sister-in-law ,1

3469,36619,1.0,"yes i too have waited for a long time to see dr.beard! beleave me when i say the wait was worth it.  dr beard is so caring and the most considerate dr. you may have to wait. he's the best most knowledgeable dr in town and every one knows it and knows that they may wait, but when it's your turn you will be his most important patient your problems are what is on his mind! thanks dear doctor ",1
3470,36619,1.0,"If you want to sit and wait for HOURS past your appointment time, then Dr. Beard is the one for you.  He is also a &quot;man's&quot; doctor in that he relates well to men, not so to women.  I always try to go to one of the other docs in his clinic if I can. However, they've made some huge boo-boo's with our son.  Can't recommend any of them.  ",-1
3471,36619,1.0,"Doesn't let you talk ,Isn't very Knowledgeable,Very rude I fear for people's Health with This DR. And Hope they do Check out the DR. First .Little Man Big Attitude.Has been turn in A number of times I hear.  ",-1
3472,36619,1.0,"My family has been a patient of Dr. Beard for the last 18 years. As time has gone by the waits have increased but then he is the busiest Dr. in Brigham City by far. He is the best Dr. I have ever been to and my wife refuses to see anyone else at all. His treatment has always been professional and superior to any that I have recieved prior to visiting with him. He is very thorough and goes out of his way to help you to understand your options in treating your problem. He is pretty outgoing, and extremely friendly, which makes him a very likable person. If you don't like a Dr. with a personality then he is not for you. I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a good Doctor.  ",1
3473,36619,1.0,It is true that this man is a bad Dr.  But if you need someone with compassion and who is great see the nurse practitioner under him named Tawna Thorton.  She is amazing!!! ,-1
3474,36619,1.0,I wouldn't even waste my time with Dr. Beard. Not willing to spend any time answering questions and will literally laugh at you for some questions. He humiliated my daughter when she told him what her problem was. I will never go to him again and would never recommend him to anyone.  ,-1
3475,36620,1.0,"Had a very brief encounter with this doctor at AF Hospital.  Was visiting family over the 4th and my son received a mosquito bite. The next day his face swelled up huge and he started to act as though he couldn't breath. Rushed him to the E.R. This doctor told me that the mosquito bite hadn't caused anything, that his airway may have been obstructed with something he ate. When I asked him about the swelling and what caused it he literally said, &quot;I didn't observe any swelling.&quot; This has been a joke in my family since we have pictures of my son (I was taking 4th of July pics) and his face looks deformed. Basically the doctor never once touched my son. He didn't look in his throat, and he obviously didn't really look at his face.  The next day I spoke to my son's allergist and he told me that my son exhibited the textbook signs of an allergic reaction to an insect bite. So Bentley = Fail in this situation. He may be a good doc in other areas, but he was not good with my son.  ",-1
3476,36625,1.0, Very knowledgeable and very courteous about my conditions.  He was able to help dramatically when others could not.  ,1
3477,36627,1.0," Dr. Dal Canto is somewhat friendly, very knowledgeable, and a great surgeon! He did a de-compression on my L3/L4, he was referred to me by my family particioner, he was very thorough, asks questions and listens, he has good bed side manner. I have had 2 de-compression surgeries, he performed the 2nd surgery and it was much better that the first as far as pain relief.  I would recommend him to anyone! ",1
3478,36629,2.0," Dr Davis is very knowledgeable, helpful and listens, Office staff and Nurse are awesome as well!!  I am very happy and gratful that I went there and was treated!! ",1
3479,36635,1.0, This doctor bedside manners were very poor and rude. He show no regards for his patient by suggesting long term over the counter drugs and when questioned he got irrated and for his patient with no insurance he show no regards  for their financial needs by prescribing medication that are almost $100 instead of generic for $4 which was later change when the pharmacy contacted the doctors office.  ,-1
3480,36637,2.0," This Dr is now retired...you need to update this site, thank you! ",1
3481,36638,0.0," Dr. Dabling is really nice. She takes her time with you and explains things pretty thoroughly. Unfortunately, the staff at her office are not very competent. I had (what appeared to be) a receptionist with no medical background call me to give me the results of a very important biopsy. She knew nothing of my situation and could not answer any questions. It was quite disappointing, as I was anxious to discuss my results. She may have been a nurse, but obviously not one who was qualified to make that call. On my very first visit, the nurse that took my medical history did so in a back area with other patients/staff there and I felt uncomfortable talking about my private medical conditions. I think they should conduct those interviews in a private room. If you see Dr. Dabling, don't expect the staff to be to professional, but she herself is very nice.  ",1
3482,36638,0.0," I really like Heather. She is everything that everyone else has said. I have felt comfortable and taken care of at each appointment with her. She answers all of my questions without rushing me through. She is knowledgeable but very personable and sweet. I haven't ever felt intimidated either, which I have felt before with other doctors. I also agree with the previous comments about the front desk receptionists. They are not very friendly at all. The ultrasound technician in the office was not very friendly either and rushed me through my ultrasound with few comments. If it weren't for Heather and her nurses, I would go somewhere else. ",1
3483,36638,0.0, Dr. Dabling is the best! I had a few scares early on in my pregnancy and she was very calming and always made me feel like everything would be ok. She never makes you feel stupid for asking questions and she makes sure you understand everything in detail. Unlike some doctors she never rushes when she's with you. Throughout my pregnancy and delivery I always felt that she had my best interest in mind.  I would recommend her 100%! ,1
3484,36638,0.0," So glad I found this office! They are great, they are almost always on time and a few times a bit early :) The front desk staff is very nice and I have had nothing but great experiences with Dr Dabling. I feel comfortable and at ease and I never feel rushed. I do however agree with the below comment about the Ultrasound tech. Highly recommend this office and Dr Dabling.  ",1
3485,36638,0.0," Dr. Dabling is so awesome!! I'm really glad I found her! She is a very sweet person and very knowledgable. She will take as much time with you as you need, even if you're a worry wart like me and have millions of questions!! She has helped me out with some issues in the past year and is now helping me with my first pregnancy, and there is NO ONE else I would rather go to!! I highly highly recommend her :) ",1
3486,36638,0.0," The receptionists are kind of cold and rude, they definitely don't make you feel welcome.      Dr. dabling and her nurse however, are WONDERFUL!  If you are pregnant for the 1st time,she's Perfect for you! She explains everything in great detail, she listens carefully and takes time with you. You never feel rushed. She's even taught me things that I didn't know, even though I have had several children already. The appointment does tend to run a bit longer then what you might be used to, but it's only because she isn't rushing your questions and concerns. She is very knowledgable.    I Did Not Care for the ultra sound technician. She was nice, but didn't give me any information other than, looks like your doctors date is about right. Your this far along. Here's your picture, how would you like to pay&#63; I was in there literally 7 minutes!  I was Very disappointed. She has nothing to do with dr. Dabbling great service though.. ",1
3487,36638,0.0," I saw Dr. Dabling during her first week practicing after her residency.  I saw her for my first pregnancy, which was ectopic.   She fit me into her schedule for multiple appointments.  She was very kind and explained everything in depth.  She was very sympathetic about the entire situation.  I loved working with her and would recommend her to anyone.  ",1
3488,36639,0.0," Wife went in 2 weeks ago for back pain, and was referred to hospital for MRI. 2 weeks later, my wife is stil in pain, and no call from Dahle, so she finally calls Dahle, to find out that she has a protruding, enlarged disc with a small tear, and that she needs to see a spinal specialist... My wife asks them to refill a pain prescription and they said they would give her a note. 2 1/2 hours later, 10 minutes before they close, my wife calls back and finds out that Dahle denied her request, cause she needs to see a specialist! So she has to suffer in pain for who knows how long, before she can see a specialist. Very poor service. Obviously Dahle doesn't care, or she wouldn't have to call them after 2 weeks to get a result, and the pain med deal is probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard... Specialists can take a month or more to get in, I should know, I have kidney cysts, and my appt. with a nephrologist is 2 months out. Am currently looking for a new family provider. ",-1
3489,36640,1.0," Dr. (and I use that title with much discomfort) Davies is not a psychologist you want to use if interested in a competent /professional evaluation or clinical services.  He seems to be more of hired gun for attorneys’ seeking biased or predictive results.      He tends to base his conclusions on selected information – he will perform psych testing, and then separate a couple responses from the battery as examples of his perspective and conclusion.  He bases his clinical outcomes on a limited knowledge of the literature, rather choosing to refer to outdated and limited references and resources.      He seems to ignore the wide body of other information available.   Quite amazing this man still has his license.      Do not use this man for any professional services.

3490,36640,1.0, This man is dangerous not to mention rude.   He actually provided examples of how &quot;he&quot; raised his children and what &quot;his&quot; values were instead of being unbiased.  This was a custody evaluation. Basing an outcome on his personal values is highly unprofessional.     Do not use him.   He did not call references on either side of the evaluation.   Do not use him if at all possible.   This is the general feeling of everyone I spoke with concerning him over several years.     This is 3 other couples.    Very male biased.   I can not say one positive thing about him. Paid/Co-pay:$3000,-1

He is part of a crooked system. Paid/Co-pay:$1500",-1
3493,36644,1.0," Due to this Dr. I had to move from Logan because I had multiple E.R. visits where my heart stopped, and he said right out loud he would not start my heart again next time it stopped, so it did stop again, and the nurse restarted it. After moving, I learned I had multiple organ failure and diabetes. My blood sugar was going too high, then too low. My adrenals and thyroid were also not working well. He did not even test my blood glucose in the many years of E.R. visits!! Due to him I lost my husband, children, country (moved to Canada) home, everything. This was when he worked at the Logan E.R. He treats everyone in serious pain as if they are criminals, instead of people in serious pain. ",-1

3498,36662,1.0," I found Dr. Davis to be very knowledgeable, kind, a good listener.  He did a complete exam with x-rays and recommended a series of treatments.

My appreciation is the greatest. ",1

She always makes you feel comfortable, answers all of your questions, explains procedures before she performs them, gives you options for care, gives you plenty of face time, she knows her stuff. The office staff aren't too helpful sometimes, but she makes up for it.  ",1
3513,36683,0.0," I went to her for my premarital exam which was kind of scary for me but she was way nice and comforting. Not nearly the nightmare everyone made it out to be.

I traveled from out of state for my surgery, and so had several phone conversations with both the doctor and his assistant, Cheron. I was most impressed and very pleased with their patience and thoroughness in explaining what I needed to know to prepare for surgery. The hospital staff was equally kind and caring. The entire experience was wonderful! I'm recovering quite rapidly, I've had absolutely NO PAIN, and I would highly recommend Dr. Dal Canto to anyone requiring an Oculoplastic Surgeon.  ",1
3520,36702,1.0," Dr. Dal Canto has done a wonderful job repairing my eyebrows and eyelids. In the beginning, he very carefully examined me to determine my conditions, then he very thoroughly explained the procedures and the options.

3526,36713,1.0," Went here for my LASIK surgery, they made the whole process understood to me, made sure I was comfortable with it.  There was one concern with my eyes possibly being unreceptive to the surgery.  They let me know the risks and understand what caused them before putting the decision in my hands.  Really, an excellent staff, all around. Paid/Co-pay:$3500",1
3527,36713,1.0," I had PRK corrective eye surgery done by Dr. Davis. My eyes are very important and I wanted someone very competent to be correcting my vision. Dr. Davis was fantastic. He was concerned with my interests and not his. I have had a number of visits with Dr. Davis and only one visit was a longer waiting time, otherwise, I had hardly any wait time (less than 15 minutes). Dr. Davis is very knowledgeable, kind, and excellent at what he does. Would recommend to anyone. ",1

3532,36722,1.0," My husband had surgery for a herniated disk last year. Dr. Felix's PA was very helpful and knowledgeable both before and after surgery.  He told us what was going on, what the surgery would entail and how to best cope and aid in recovery. I saw  Dr. Felix twice: just after surgery where he clearly told me how the surgery had gone as well as brief instructions instructions for recovery. He came against the next morning to talk to my husband. He was clear, polite, and thorough.  I hope we.never need his services again. , but if we do, we'll gladly return! ",1
3533,36722,1.0, This doctor is not helpful. He throws you asside as soon as surgery is done. If you have other issues. TOO BAD--find another doctor. I did and I must have additional surgery. Stay away.  ,-1
3534,36722,1.0, Dr. Felix saved my moms life and has stayed on top of her care once she was moved to a rehab facility.  He is an amazing surgeon and doctor.  ,1
3535,36722,1.0," I only saw the physician twice during the ENTIRE course of the care.Consult before surgery &amp; a 5 minute visit after surgery.His staff was more interested in visiting with my friend that was attending the visit with me,than my symptoms.I asked them for a referral to a pain management clinic,which they never offered.I asked them for a detailed plan of care,his staff told me that I was too needy and that they didn't have time for all of my questions.I was on medication that caused me to feel disconnected and it was difficult to remember and think, and they knew this.They made every effort to shuffle me in and out the door with as little contact as possible.I was admitted to the ER for a different issue months after the surgery and I did not know about laws regarding pain medications.They treated me like a criminal and told me that I was a liar.After a long harassing phone call where they accused me of manipulating the system,they requested that I not come back.VERY poor care!! Paid/Co-pay:$96000",-1
3536,36722,1.0, Biggest problem with Dr. Felix is that he uses an unknowledgeable P.A. to take care of all of the pre-surgery and post surgery appointments.  If things are wrong the P.A. is no help.  So you are on your own after surgery. ,-1
3537,36722,1.0," I guess I was confused with Dr. Felix.  I don't know how to rate this.  I too was farmed out to the PA for the pre-surgery physical and after surgery care.  Dr. Felix did a grade Excellent (5) job on the surgery.  I have absolutely no concerns about that.  It was more the care before and after not done by Dr. Felix.  I have other chronic medical conditions that require physicians care and need to be looked at especially when considering surgery.  The PA acted as if didn't really know how to approach them. After not even examining me for the pre-surgery physical (he just asked questions), I had my own GP to do one. I know the PA was upset that I had not trusted his judgment.  I just wanted to be careful with my other conditions. I guess I would rate the surgery by the surgeon a 5.  The PA a 3.  ",1
3538,36722,1.0," he fixed my sicatic nerve that a disc. was pushing on by a little tiny incison and trimming some of the disc. I couldn't walk in that morning because of the pain and weekness,but after OUT PATIENT SURGERY I could walk with NO PAIN or WEEKNESS at all, and have had no trouble whatsoever including NO VISITS to a choirpractor for 8years now.

3539,36725,0.0," When we moved here from Florida I was on the hunt for a new ob.  The one I left was the BEST and I was sad to have to find a new one.  I didn't think anyone could match up, but match up Gretchen did!  She is wonderful! She is personable, knowledgeable and willing to help you deliver a baby the way YOU want to!  And I never felt like I was being rushed in any way. I liked her so much that I made the drive from West Jordan to Salt Lake just so i could see her.  And it was worth the extra drive time. ",1

I would highly recommend Gretchen to anyone. ",1
3542,36725,0.0," I met with Gretchen for a consultation when I was trying to decide on midwives, and she was very knowledgeable but seemed a little pessimistic. Her practice was 45 minutes behind schedule and they ended up billing me for my &quot;no-charge&quot; consultation after I decided against using their services. I wasn't actually a patient of Gretchen, so she may be a great midwife, but I didn't appreciate the pessimism and lack of punctuality. ",1
3543,36725,0.0, wonderful midwife. very caring and very supportive through my c-section.  ,1
3544,36725,0.0," I just delivered my fourth child with Gretchen and I think she was wonderful.  She was very helpful and attentive at every visit.  During delivery there were some potential complications and the nurses acted very worried.  Once Gretchen got there, everything calmed down.  She was calm, kind and carried the delivery off like it was not a big deal. Everything went as well as it could have.   So helpful and understanding.  ",1
3545,36735,1.0," He is FANTASTIC. Caring and loving, patient and kind. He is a great doctor. Went for an IUD. He was patient and understanding. He delivered a friends premature babies and was great with them too. They love him also. ",1
3546,36735,1.0, I have never felt so comfortable with a doctor until I met Dr Fagnant. He is very honest and straight forward with answers.

3553,36746,1.0," I had a retina detachment, it was terrifying. He took care of me and told me to call immediately night or day if there were any other complications. He is a good doctor.  ",1

3557,36750,0.0," Our third pregnancy was high risk and we were sent to have a ultrasound done at Maternal Fetal Medicine on week 12. Although I suspected from the image on the screen and the technician's grim face, Dr. Feltovits had the awful weight of delivering the news: our baby looked very ill. Through the following hours, days, weeks, months she was everything a doctor, nurse, friend can be. She was there with  care, sensitivity, advice, support, knowledge, kind words, truth, explanations, honesty. Dr Feltovits and her fellow medical professionals are truly dedicated. They care about their patients' comfort, feelings, physical and emotional well being, because they are in their care; regardless their work hours or weekends. Although losing our child was unavoidable, we were surrounded by the best, most knowledgable, and caring doctors I know. They are personable,  kind and professional.  I would highly recommend Dr Feltovits and Maternal Fetal Medicine as whole ",1
3558,36752,1.0," I had an awful experience with Dr. Farley. First was, when 39 weeks  along he scratched the bag of waters, I can't remember the medical term they call that procedure and then he left town. Well of course I went into labor that evening and so he was not there to deliver which I was so disappointed because I don't like seeing a doctor for 9 months only to have another doctor deliver. Then another time he perscribed antifungal creams over and over to the point that the skin in the genital area was so raw that I could not even sit down.He refused to see me when I called the office-referred me out to a dermotologist.  Come to find out with another OB/GYN doctor that I had a bacterial infection and not a yeast infection and a skin condition called lichen scheloris. Dr. Farley had the audacity to tell me that I had an &quot;old lady&quot; disease when I called back to tell me he had misdiagnosed me-I was 33 at the time. Thanks for nothing Dr. Farley ",-1
3559,36752,1.0, Dr. Farley is an amazing doctor. I had him deliver #2 and #4 I couldn't with #3 because of insurance reasons. He is so caring when problems arise and he is great at helping you understand what is going on. He'll stay in your room and answer questions until you have no more. He is also great to work with and when in labor he gives you the utmost respect. I have been to a lot of OB's and Dr. Farley is by far my favorite.  ,1
3560,36752,1.0," Dr. Farley is an excellent doctor and surgeon. (He has also been complemented by his colleagues on his skills in my presence.) I always feel that his decisions are based on much experience and his gut feelings. I trust him very much. He is willing to work with you if you have difficult circumstances, and is very friendly to families (I really appreciate how he treats my other children when I have to bring them with me). He always tries to make sure you understand what's happening to you, and is compassionate when things go wrong. (I have been grateful for his caring manner in my circumstances and in the circumstances of others I know.) I appreciate that he is timely, but also tries to make sure that each patient has adequate time for her needs and questions.  I also appreciate his genuine manner--I feel like an adult in his office.  My friends and I continue to go to his practice, even though it's not very close to home, becuase we feel he is such an excellent doctor and a good man.  ",1
3561,36757,1.0, I love this guy! Dr. Fairbanks has helped me tremendously in dealing with my depression. He is very thorough and helped me through issues that started in my childhood and still continue today. He helped me set doable goals that really changed my negative thought process and helped improve my relationship with my husband. He even helped me set up a dicipline program for my kids to help reduce my stress at home & it really works! ,1
3562,36758,1.0," First off I was in the waiting room for 90 MINUTES before being seen.  Second, they are ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE about calling back or returning calls regarding blood tests!  I had tests done checking multiple things (one being cancer) and never received a call back with the results.  I have called many times requesting te results with no answer from them.  I had read some bad reviews before my appt and wish I had listened to them.  DO NOT go to Dr.  Falahati and honestly I would avoid the entire office completely!  They clearly dont care about whats wrong with you and must only be in it for the $$$  WORST EXPERIENCE WITH A DOCTOR AND DOCTORS OFFICE EVER!!! ",-1
3563,36758,1.0," I did wait over 1 hr to see Dr Falahati. I was hesistant given the reviews. But now 2 years later things are different. His nurse Becky is great. His nurse practioner Dave is also great. Daves nurse not so great but Becky is always there and helpful. No, you don't get to see the Dr every time. But his staff is so much better than when I started. Dave and Becky are super and when you see Dr Falahati he is good. I didn't find him arrogant at all. But he does tell it like it is. So, sometimes the truth hurts. My last Dr never told me how seriously my actions were affecting my health. Now I am healthier and happier and Dr. Falahti, Dave and Becky are responsible for that.  ",1
3564,36758,1.0," Only saw Falahati once. Had blood tests done, never called me back. It took six weeks and numerous phone calls before someone could give me results. After surgery I was seen by his PA who possessed very little knowledge of my situation. In fact he didn't know why I was there. Will never return to this clinic.  ",-1
3565,36758,1.0, Most of the negative comments about this doctor were right on.  The only time I've seen him he wanted me to take a bunch of tests and then come back in 3 months!  I didn't know the results took 3 months (they didn't). Very snotty female assistant. ,-1
3566,36758,1.0," I had to insist on seeing a doctor not a nurse practitioner. And I worry that I keep recving increasing dosages of thyroid medicine without a blood test to confirm my TSH, T4, T3 levels. It is impossible to reach him by phone or to have a call returned. Has not happened in years. (ever) (and yes, this is the only endocrinologist my insurance will accept) But, he IS friendly. Very very busy but friendly. ",-1
3567,36758,1.0," Very disorganized, waited over an hour to see him and was quite disappointed. He treated me poorly and was rude to his staff in fron of me! Would never return to his office if my life depended on it. ",-1
3568,36758,1.0, I found the Dr very friendly and helpful.  Did not feel he had one foot out the door while talking to us.  ,1
3569,36758,1.0," Dr.Falahati's competence level exceeds any expectations. His area of expertise is wider than endocrinology. He succeeded in curing my &quot;IBS symptoms&quot; when gastro-enterologist and internal med doctor failed repeatedly.Dr.is highly educated professional, keeps up with all the new advances of medicine. Strongly recommend to anybody.  ",1
3570,36758,1.0, this doctor is the worst doc i ever meet in my life he and his staff dnt give crap about pts and can care less if pts are ok or not i do not recomend &quot;dr. falahati&quot; if thats what he really is!!!!!!!!!!! Paid/Co-pay:$300,-1
3571,36758,1.0, I found Dr. Falahati and his entire staff to be very friendly and helpful. I can always make appointments to see him with out it being scheduled out three months. He took time to answer all of my questions and my condition has dramatically improved since seeing him.  ,1
3572,36758,1.0," Arrogant. Told me if I wasn't going to follow his advice, I might as well see the janitor. He had missed something that my next doctor found, that explained why I was not seeing the results he expected. I was following his directions.  ",-1
3573,36758,1.0, Very slow in analizing bloodwork results and sending recommendations back to patient.  ,1
3574,36758,1.0," I would not recommend this doctor to anyone.  He is uncaring.  He does not take time with his patients.  His office staff is horrible, and follow up care is no where to be found.  ",-1
3575,36758,1.0, His diagnosis and treatment was right on. I would recommend him to anyone ,1
3576,36758,1.0," Going to see Dr. Falahati was the worse experience ever!!  If you are looking for a doctor that is rude and uncaring then he would be the one for you.  Needless to say, I am looking for another doctor. ",-1
3577,36758,1.0," I have been seeing Dr. Falahati for almost 2 years for a very painful condition called Paget's Disease. He is very knowledgeable about the condition and as a result I have had successful results. I am still in treatment for this condition but the improvement under his care has been dramatic! He is very straight forward and comes right to  the point, I appreciate this very much! I never have to wonder what is next as he answers my questions and explains my course of treatment.   ",1
3578,36758,1.0," Dr. Falahati is extremly arrogant and down right rude. I went to him for my Type 1 juvenile Diabetes and he did nothing for me but told me I was like a dog chasing my tail and totally denied my request for an Insulin Pump, my HgbA1c was off the charts high and he basically sent me on my way. I walked out to my car and cried. Never would I recommend this doctor, and I have heard from others that he is arrogant and you leave his office feeling worse than when you came in.  ",-1
3579,36758,1.0," I have been seeing this doctor for 18 mos. He is very rude and arrogent. On one visit I was complaining of some depression and fatigue, he pointed to the lab results for my blood tests and said there is nothing wrong with me. His office personnel seem to be overworked and disorganized. I called two weeks ago to get a lab order for blood work needed for my next appointment and was left on hold for 30 minutes only to be eventually hung up on. I called back and was sent to his nurses voice mail. I left a message but have not heard back. I am currently finding another doctor.  ",-1
3580,36758,1.0," I have seen Dr. Falahati once.  The wait was very long, but worth it.  The second visit was with his nurse practitioner who spent the time with me that I needed.  She was able to adequately describe to me what needs to be done with my thyroid.  I would without a doubt recommened this team.  They have been wonderful at getting back to me promptly.  The only problem that I have found that with my returned phone calls the nurses did not know what they were talking about. ",1
3581,36758,1.0," I thought Dr. Falahati and his staff were great. I had a very positive experience there. The receptionist's at the front desk were very busy and acted somewhat bothered by my being there for my appointment but the nurses and the Dr. himself were on time, polite, concerned and friendly. I appreciated Dr. Falahati being so thorough with my situation and he gave me his COMPLETE ATTENTION while I was there. He also explained things to me so that they were easy to understand and asked if I had questions. I would recommend him to anyone.  ",1
3582,36758,1.0," WORST DOCTOR EVER! I had radiation ablation at the docs advice. Afterward, he said it's normal to experience worsening symptoms after treatment for 4-8 weeks.  I have been MUCH worse since. I asked then for a medical leave letter from Dr. Falahati to give to my job while getting better. I was told by his nurse they'd approve leave for 3 weeks. As soon as I hung up with his nurse, Dr. Falahati called and told me, without asking how I was doing or what I was experiencing, that I was taking advantage of him, I am not sick, I am lying, etc. This coming from a doctor that has only met me once and never asked what my concerns are or why I was requesting a note. I said &quot;why, if I'm lying, did your office repeatedly tell me that I would be experiencing these symptoms for 4-8 weeks&#63; Were THEY lying&#63; He said I didn't know what I was talking about and to stop taking advantage of him. I told him he was fired and hung up. I have never been treated so unkindly by a physician.  ",-1
3583,36758,1.0," Dr. Falahati is a great doctor. My first visit, I went to see him for my thyroid problem. He was very attentive and extremely polite. My second visit, I saw his nurse, Ms. Jensen. She was just as thorough and helpful.  This guy is awsome! ",1
3584,36758,1.0, He doesn't see his patients personally. When you make an appointment with him you'll be attended for his no-idea was is going on nurse practicioner Tausha Jones.  ,-1
3585,36758,1.0," I am Type 2 Diabetic, 80 years old.           Last THREE visits I saw Dr. Falahati ONCE; other two visits I was seen by his &quot;Nurse Practitioner.&quot;           On my last visit, in June, Dr. Falahati sent me to a lab to get my AIC results. I HAVE NOT HEARD SINCE FROM DR. FALAHATI. As I was concerned about my AIC I went to the lab myself and got my AIC rating: 8.3! This high, I would have expected to hear from Dr. Falahati (or, his Nurse Practitioner.) I haven't, to-date.        For some reason Dr. Falahati is no longer with the Clinic he was in, is now sharing an office with a Podiatrist (!) ",1
3586,36758,1.0, His staff is as bad as he is. He has a new nurse practitioner who does not listen to what the patients' needs are. The girl helping his nurse practitioner is rude and uncaring. My husband's sugar level sky rocketed because he couldn't get a prescription for his insulin. He uses the U500 and he has been pushed from pillar to post and NO-ONE seems to care or want to help. His GP did not want to step on Falahati's toes so he's been shying away from helping. It's all political but here is a man with diabetes who NEEDS the insulin and around him are doctors who are supposed to HELP but too scared to do the right thing.  I would not recommend Falahati as his work load has doubled and his support staff/office is totally disorganized and in total state of chaos which is breeding grounds for errors!  We will be finding a new endocronolgist soon.  ,-1
3587,36758,1.0," I have been his patient for two years.  He is  thorough,the treatment he prescribed for my osteoporosis worked  and that's all I care about. I would recommend him to anyone.  ",1
3588,36758,1.0," This is the worst Dr I have ever seen and I work in the Medical field.  I recently had a sudden onset of periferal edema and my Primary care was concerned about my adrenal function.  He sent me to Falahati who acted completely indifferent about my symptoms.  He did order some labs which a week later I had to basically beg to get the results of.  His &quot;nurse&quot; left me a message that all was good except one level was slightly low and I needed a script.  Two weeks later now she still has not called it out to my pharmacy.  To top off the cake, today I received a call from Utah Cancer Specialists.  They were calling to schedule my appointment that dr falahati referred me for.  I was never notified by this quack that I need to see anyone else much less a CANCER specialist.  I have tried calling to find out what this appt is for and if he ever planned to notify me, but have gotten no response and the oncologists won't schedule my appt until he has talked to me about my condition. ",-1
3589,36758,1.0, Dr. Falahati was very knowlegable and took time with me to find out what my problem was.  He was right on with the diagnosis and I found him to be very pleasant and thoughtful.  I would recommend him highly. ,1
3590,36758,1.0," If anybody sends you to this doctor, DON'T GO, he is awful.  Stay far away from him.  Get a different refferal. ",-1
3591,36758,1.0, He is uncaring selfish and very arrogant. He was the worst doctor ever. He was very disrespectful to say the least.  ,-1
3592,36758,1.0, He was very arrogant and judgemental.  Spoke ill of other physicians and blew off past medical results.  Would never refer someone to him or go back. ,-1
3593,36758,1.0," I was referred to Dr. Falahati by my obstetrician. I rate him with 1 on service, helpfulness and knowledge because of the following: He was INCREDIBLY rude to me. When I explained to him my problem (relating to polycystic ovarian syndrome) he told me I was lying and refused to listen any more. This obviously made me a little upset. When he saw that, he told me I needed to get on some antidepressants and left the room. I remain astonished at the lack of professionalism with which I was treated. I should note that his staff was friendly. Paid/Co-pay:$35",-1
3594,36758,1.0," On one visit he yelled at me, said I complain too much, He asked me how I felt, should I have said great&#63; He rolled his eyes when I told him about an episode where my blood sugar hit 30. While I was still in the office I asked for a prescription and he kept me waiting over an hour. He was mean and egotistical ! ",-1
3595,36758,1.0," VERY poor bedside manner. Spent very little time with me, and while he was in the room he said I was wasting his time by being there (criticizing previous doctors I have seen for this current issue) and didn't perform a proper exam - he was even about to walk out the door before he realized he had not even felt my thyroid! ",-1
3596,36758,1.0, Excellen bedside manner. Very knowledgable and friendly. Outstanding staff! ,1
3597,36758,1.0, Dr. Falahati found a great surgeon for me to get my thyroid removed after he suspected thyroid cancer. They detected it very early and they were able to take it out with no side effects. He is very knowledgeable and very thorough. ,1
3598,36758,1.0," I was very dissatisfied with this MD, poor bedside manner, abrupt. I give him a rating of &lt;1, his staff and nurse a 4+ rating.  ",-1
3599,36759,0.0, Dr. Farley-Jones is pleasant and takes whatever time is needed.  She can be late for appointments as a result.  She was helpful to me.  She has a store in her office that sells food upplements.  I was a little turned off by what seemed to be a conflict of interest with her recommending things that she also sells.  The first visit resulted in me purchasing $170 worth of her supplements. I must admit that I did get several problems resolved that other doctors had been unable to solve.  ,1
3600,36766,0.0, Such a great office! Dr.  Faircloth and her nurse Natalie are excellent! I called to get some advice and change a prescription and Natalie was cheerful and very knowledgeable! ,1
3601,36766,0.0," Dr. Faircloth was a great doctor. Like others have said I felt like she was a friend rather than just a doctor. She took time to get to know what was going on and after having surgery on ruptured cysts we found out 4 months later we were pregnant! I was so excited because I never thought I would have that chance. Throughout my whole pregnancy she was so helpful and near the end I became high risk and she did not skip a beat with trying to find out what was wrong. She ended up inducing me and came in on her day off when she was supposed to be leaving out of town to deliver me. I cannot say enough good things about her. We have recently moved back to Texas and I am sad she will no longer be my OBGYN, and hoping I can find somewhere here just as caring and patient as she was.  Good doctors are hard to find! ",1
3602,36766,0.0, Dr. Faircloth was absolutly wonderful.  I had a high risk pregnancy and she was awesome.  She worked with my Neuroligist to treat me and even spent a lot of time filling out paperwork for my short term disability from work.  I saw her every other week for months.  She always took the time to answer all my questions and I felt like she was not only my Dr. but a friend as well.  When it came time to deliver my son she came in on her day off so she could deliver him.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Faircloth.  I'm now pregnant with my second child and wish she could be my Dr. however she isn't covered on my husbands new insurance. :( Hopefully my next Dr. will be half as wonderful as Dr. Faircloth is.  I would recommend her to anyone.  ,1
3603,36766,0.0, I thought Dr. Faircloth was a wonderful doctor. She was kind attentive and offered several options to the pain I was having. She was the third doctor I have been to for the same problem but the first one to listen and care. ,1
3604,36766,0.0," Doctor Faircloth was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when my wife had pre-eclampsia.  She took her time to explain every detail to us, and answer all of our questions.  When it came time to deliver, and my wife was not progressing as fast as they'd hoped, she came to the hospital on her day off and helped.  I would recommend her to absolutely anyone.  ",1
3605,36766,0.0," Dr. Faircloth is wonderful. I have been having trouble with PCOS and other doctors have just put it off and that I would pretty much have to deal with it. Now I am trying to get pregnant and she was so quick to get my history and when one of the cysts ruptured, took no time to send me into surgery and ended up finding more than we thought. She is just so knowledgable and caring and I could not ask for a better OBGYN! I can't wait to get pregnant, and thank her for all of her help!! I would recommend her to anyone! Great office and staff too.  ",1
3606,36773,1.0," What a terrible experience for my father, a United State's vetran. His staff lost important paperwork then lied about it.  They also have no training in dealing with PTSD, a now common ailment of those returning home from war.  Dr. Ferguson may be a great doctor, but the trauma of making an appointment extinguishes any skills he may have.  I would skip the heartache and find a different doctor.  He's cost our family so much. ",-1
3607,36775,1.0, Awesome doctor! I am so happy I went to him for my pregnancy care. He was always very friendly and took time to talk about any concerns I had. He was amazing during delivery. I could not be happier with him! As for the previous reviewer... I did not have insurance when i first went to him and he suggested I try for medicaid. He was not rude about it at all. I also know someone who went to him during her pregnancy and who was on medicaid. She also really liked him.  That sucks there have been bad reviews but i really can't see any reason why I wouldn't tell everyone what an awesome dr he is! ,1
3608,36775,1.0," I did not enjoy my experience at all.I was pregnant with my 3rd he kept pushing me to take the Progesterone shot after I had refused it.(made it to 39 weeks without the shot). Told me he wanted me to pick it up at a certain pharmacy because I had medicaid and he was a tax payer and it was cheaper for him at this pharmacy in Logan. It was 30 mnts. from my house, it was the middle of winter,had to drive thru the canyon. Said he would have me pay for what I used and would give the rest to other patients. Made me drive out there again to pick it up for him. 40 minute wait for every appt. then it was another 10 mnt. wait. I dreaded every appt. Refuses to deliver at the Tremonton hospital. He lives in BC,doesn't want to drive out to Tremonton. I switched to Dr Miller in Tremonton at 30 weeks. He was GREAT!Loved him. Also a family DR so he saw my son after delivery. I do not rcmmd Dr Ferguson. Awful bedside manner. He made me feel horrible for having medicaid, never listened to what I wanted.  ",-1
3609,36775,1.0," Dr. Ferguson is amazing!  He delivered my twins and my last baby.  I drive an hour and a half each way to see him (he used to work in the city I live in and moved...I followed him) I know it is a long way, but it is worth every second of drive time to have him helping me.  I continue to recommend friends, even though there are many OB's here in town.  I can't say enough about his bedside manner and his patience.  I always feel like I am his only patient!  AMAZING! ",1
3610,36775,1.0, He is extremely patient and kind.  He has been very professional and I have never felt uncomfortable with him.  He has delivered 2 of my 5 and I will continue to recommend him. ,1
3611,36775,1.0, Dr. Ferguson is the best obgyn I've had.  Literally a life-saver for our family.  I drive an hour and a half just to see him.  He's that good.  ,1
3612,36775,1.0," great physician, very helpful and concerned. I would suggest him to anyone ",1
3613,36776,1.0," I went to the office of Spinal Interventions, and was greeted by a wonderful staff. They were very friendly, and great to work with. They listened to me, and took really go care of me. I felt like I'd been listened to, and they took their time. I then meet with one of their Nurses who was really knowledgeable and helped me understand my pain. They gave me tips, and advice I'd never heard before. I was excited to hear that there was hope for me! After meeting with the nurse they had the DR. come in and talk with me. He was very sweet, and knowledgeable as well.  Overall my experience was fantastic there! I was very happy with my time there, and would recommend them to anyone! ",1
3614,36776,1.0," Dr Faber has very good bedside manner. He is very knowledgeable and kind. He has done many procedures for me.  He can put an IV in like none other. I hardly and most of the time never feel a thing. If you need someone who really knows what they are doing... he is a master of his profession! Dr Faber is an anesthesiologist and knows his anatomy. Working with back and neck nerves is very complicated and scary for the  patient. And it does take time to find the right nerves to fix, so be patient. He does know how to help!  There is another doctor in his office who is really nice... but not nearly as good as Dr. Faber.  You do have to wait for an appointment.  This doctor is worth the wait! ",1
3615,36779,0.0, She is very knowledgeable doctor. She ruled out that there was a problem with placenta on my ultrasound and admittied to hospital right away.  ,1
3616,36780,1.0," He followed me through two broken 5th metatarsals, one needing surgery.  He is willing to take suggestions, like having a dexascan at a young age which showed osteopenia.  Good bedside manner and explains things really well.  Since he specializes in foot/ankle issues, he had a lot (too many I guess) patients, but I would be willing to wait for his expertise again in the future.  Perhaps his staff could schedule him better, and maybe they do now.  It has been many years since I saw him.  ",1
3617,36780,1.0, Very thorough and knowledgeable. He was kind and explained things well. Was willing to squeeze me into very busy office and surgery schedule. Was patient with my questions. ,1
3618,36780,1.0, Dr. Faux is an excellent doctor and I wouldn't have anyone else if I needed foot surgery.  He is friendly and helpful but the office wait is always long since he is so popular.  ,1
3619,36782,0.0, Simply wonderful. She helped us find out what was causing my daughters abdominal pain. She took the time to explain everything and assess all options. love her. ,1
3620,36783,0.0," This doctor is either inexperienced or uneducated because time after time, she's misdiagnosed or missed clear warning signs.  She has no sense of urgency and spends little time asking questions. A few of her mistakes have almost caused grave outcomes.  She either needs to change the way she practices medicine or find a field she can enjoy and actual have some success at. ",-1
3621,36783,0.0," It did take me 3 weeks to get in but I'm so glad I went to Dr. Fedor. She spent quite a bit of time with me and took a lot of time assessing my problem. She was quick to ascertain what the problem may be. Dr. Fedor will now be my physician of choice. I have had the same doctor for 17 years and Dr. Fedor is the first one I have found that I am even more comfortable with. I highly recommend her, ",1
3622,36783,0.0, Very impersonal. Does not care for patient input. Not interested in previous doctor diagnosis. Does not treat pain. I would rate her very poor.  ,-1
3623,36783,0.0," Approximately one week ago, I called to make an appointment with Dr. Fedor.  My mission was to look into finding another healthcare provider closer to Layton.  The receptionist or secretary who answered the phone asked me what insurance I had, and I told her PCN and that she could obtain all my records on MyHealth through IHC.  She blatantly told me that Dr. Fedor would not prescribe narcotics, if that is what I was after.  I was stunned!  I told her to look up my records and that only took drugs for depression (Celexa), Synthroid for my thyroid, high cholesterol medication and Relafen for managing my pain from osteoarthritis.  I don't know if I have ever been on a narcotic other than in 2002 when I had surgery.   The receptionist also said, &quot;I'll send the doctor an email to see if she's interested in taking you on.&quot; I have never been so humiliated in my life.  This kind of behavior from a receptionist or assistant is unacceptable. At the very least, that receptionist should be fired. ",-1
3624,36784,1.0, He was great with my child.  He has a really good bedside manner.  He was fast to see us and made sure we understood everything.  I would like to have him as our family doctor.  He reflects positively on the hospital emergency room. ,1
3625,36785,1.0, I have been a patient of Dr. Fenton's for about five years now and I have nothing but good things to say about him.  He is very knowledgeable and makes you feel very comfortable.  I always feel like he actually cares about me and my health.  He takes as much time as is needed during my appointments and during any treatments he explains the procedure thoroughly beforehand so you know what to expect.  He is one of the few doctors that I have ever had that I feel is a genuinely kind and compassionate person.  There should be more out there like Dr. Fenton!  He is amazing! ,1
3626,36785,1.0, Dr. Fenton is a wonderful person. He did my colonoscopy and was so kind and thoughtful. He explained everything and made it very easy. I would definately recommend him! ,1
3627,36785,1.0," I had him as my colonoscopy first time doctor-- was excellent.  he also treated me for ulcers.  again, great.  ",1
3628,36786,2.0, excellent doctor ,1
3629,36790,1.0, Dr. Fellows has always been very attentive and helpful. I will only go to him because he seems to sincerely care about each person and how to improve their eye problems. I was not impressed with the other doctor who didn't seem interested or attentive. Gavin is also amazing and very personable.  ,1
3630,36790,1.0," Dr Fellows is outstanding and very understanding. My family has been going to him for a decade now. There was a noticeable change in the office when Dr Mortenson arrived. The old time friendly Dr seemed to disappear and the business end took over. In place of the hi how are you type of greeting we were used to it's now who is your insurance carrier, how you pay for today's visit&#63;    It is obvious the length of time spent on patients is less than before, the front desk staff needs allot of training and a bit f compassion.  ",1
3631,36790,1.0," Dr. Fellows is outstanding. When I had a serious eye infections, he immediately referred my to a reputable opthamologist. He has also been kind, attentive, and thorough at my appointments. The only drawback is the lack of warmth and courtesy from his office staff, and that issue has existed for about ten years. Both the Draper and Sandy offices have assistants and receptionists who need much more training in customer service. Dr. Fellows, you and your patients deserve outstanding support staff! ",1
3632,36790,1.0, I have been to multiple eye doctors trying to find one that I like. Doctor Fellows exceeded my expectations! He was by far the best doctor I have ever been to. He was very patient and thorough. He seemed to really care about me and helping me see the best I can! I will for sure be returning to him for all my future eye exams! Paid/Co-pay:$85,1
3633,36790,1.0," This was the worst most inconsiderate Doctor of any kind I have ever been to.  He triple booked the time for my first appointment and only seen me for one minute, then scheduled a follow up.  On the follow up, he was in the office when I arrived, but again bouncing from patient to patient.  His Med. Techs. ran me through some tests, and he never even had the consideration to meet with me or go over the results.  Upon finishing my test, I learned he had left the office to go to another branch he works at.  Very inconsiderate, and never would I go to him again! ",-1
3634,36792,2.0, This doctor is the best doctor that I have ever been to! Paid/Co-pay:$200,1
3635,36793,0.0, We have been taking out son to Dr. Karla for many years.  She is very thorough and always listens to our concerns.  I love how she asks the patient questions and not the parent. My son has always felt comfortable with her and always tells me how great a doctor she is when we leave the office.  Really sad that now he is an adult and can no longer have her as his doctor.  ,1
3636,36793,0.0, I think she is great.  I never feel rushed during my kids check ups.  Dr.Feindt and her nurse Danielle have handled all of our &quot;sick&quot; visits with great care. ,1
3637,36793,0.0, She is by far one of the BEST PED. Doc's around this area.  She has been my granchildrens Doc sense 2002.  We have never been treatede with anything but total respect.  I would recommend her.  ,1
3638,36794,0.0," She is the BEST OBGYN for a natural delivery, she was more supportive than the Mid wife that was fired from the clinic.  ",1
3639,36795,2.0, Does not show much interest to problems of aging patients. Tends to excuse symptoms as natural aging Without looking into more thoroughly. ,1
3640,36801,1.0," He is a fine doctor however the wait time is very long. I waited for over an hour when my baby was sick. Also, every time I call to make an appointment the staff puts me on hold for a long time and they are not helpful at all whenever I go in. When I had to wait, they did not apologize or acknowledge me at all. ",1
3641,36801,1.0, Dr. Farnsworth is WONDERFUL! I couldn't have chosen a better pediatrician for my children. I have been nothing but impressed in the last 3 years of taking my kids to him. He always knows exactly what he's talking about while other dr's might hum and haw about conditions. He is extremely knowledgeable and I have complete confidence in him. He always addresses all my concerns and answers all my questions at EVERY visit - sick visit or well check. Utah Valley Pediatrics has a wonderful staff of nurses and doctors as well. They are always available for consultation over the phone. I wouldn't want to take my children anywhere else. ,1
3642,36801,1.0," Dr. Farnsworth is amazing.  I feel so at ease with him, and my almost-two year old daughter does, too, which is amazing.  He is very knowledgable, gentle, and reassuring.  He listens carefully, and looks at you while you talk, instead of at his computer.  I highly recommend him and the Utah Valley Pediatrics practice. ",1
3643,36801,1.0," Dr. Farnsworth is wonderful. He really knows his stuff! He diagnosed a heart murmur that my daughter's cardiologist was amazed to learn he had heard with just a stethoscope. He is very friendly and gentle, even though my son pretty much just screams through every appointment.  ",1
3644,36807,2.0,  ,1
3645,36811,1.0," I love Dr Gardner, he is the best  dentist we ever had.  Because of our insurance change, we had to get a new dentist. We whished he was still our dentist.  He always takes time to explain and make sure the work is done well. My kids love him too. He has even called us in the past after a more &quot;surgery&quot; to make sure we were ok.  Definitely the best! ",1
3646,36814,1.0," I have spent much time with Dr. Gardner and I believe he is one of the smartest people alive!  Dr. Gardner truly is compassionate and a class individual! The epitome of professionalism and integrity.     One hundred Percent accurate Diagnosis, he was deeply concerned that I receive the help I needed.  Brilliant and caring, most highly recommended.  Thank you Dr. Gardner ",1
3647,36818,2.0," Very friendly staff and great service.  Really good Dentist, and gentle. ",1
3648,36820,1.0, He has done 4 angiograms on me &amp; placed 7 stents. He is very very bright &amp; is one of the best at what he does. I feel absolutely safe &amp; comfortable in his hands as he has saved my life at least twice. You can't find better! ,1
3649,36820,1.0," This was my first visit to Dr. Ganellen after being referred to him by my regular doctor who by the way had open heart surgery by Dr. Ganellen. I went to see this doctor as I have been having palpitations for several months and they are getting worse. When I arrived I waited for 35 minutes before being called back. Then another 10 minutes in the exam room. Once Dr. Ganellen came into the exam room, he never introduced himself nor even attempted to shake my hand. He was very unfriendly and before I could explain why I was there, his assistant interrupted and he had to leave. The next thing I knew, his assistant came in and said, &quot;the doctor wants an EKG&quot;. I had it done and left to sit and wait some more. When the doctor came back I asked if he could explain the EKG to me but he never got around to it. He never listened to my heart while there and I was given a 24 hr. holter monitor but never got the results. My BP was 172/109 but he didn't seem to care. I wouldn't recommend him. ",-1
3650,36823,2.0,  ,1
3651,36827,0.0," Dr. Gagner is a very nice doc. She is friendly, compassionate, helpful and very professional. I recommend her. We loved having her as our family pediatrician and we are sad that we have to go to another one because of insurance change. ",1
3652,36827,0.0," I would recommend Dr. Gagner to any family with small children.  She is attentive, caring, and compassionate.  I especially appreciate her knowledge and wonderful bedside manner with both the child and the parents.  Dr. Gagner is a top notch medical professional and she would score the highest marks from our family.  ",1
3653,36828,1.0, Best local Doctor in his field.  Takes time to know his patients and remembers all about them. His knowledge of medicine and people is unsurpassed.  ,1
3654,36828,1.0,".  Excellent knowledge base and great bedside manner, he is the best internist in the valley ",1
3655,36828,1.0,".  Excellent physician, Staff is always very efficient their jobs (fast) ",1
3656,36832,1.0," In March of 2001 I went to Dr. Thomas Garrison for a liver enzyme test, because a few week prior I was sexually assaulted at WSU. He asked me who was going to pay for it, and that he didn't perform that test in his ER even though a doctor in the same ER told me to come in for the test. Needless to say he asked me who was going to pay for the blood test and I said victims assistance and he then said &quot; Young lady it costs tax payers $ 500 for you to walk through that door and you are a waste of taxpayers money&quot; I decided that if he didn't take rape seriously and the care after a trumatic event...I didn't want him to take my blood. He treated me horribly and then had the nerve to bill me for services never rendered, which my father had to call the hospital about. He made a situation what was horrible for me, worse. If you are a victim of rape.. he is not the ER doctor to see..ask for another doctor.He should be ashamed of himself and I am even more appalled that this man is head of the ER ",-1
3657,36832,1.0," I am a RN and familiar with standards of care. Felt Dr was very forceful, incorrect and out of line in initiating a forceful assessment. The findings made no sense and were incorrect. Other ER staff were very rude. Many errors occured. A terrible and shocking experience. ",-1
3658,36837,1.0," I disagree with the negative ratings of Dr. Vikas Garg. My friend and I travel for more than 2 hours (from Pleasant Grove to Logan)just to see him. We feel that he's worth the trip because he's the best that we've found yet. We've done this trip multiple times for her neck pain. He and his staff have always been extremely helpful,knowledgable and caring. We keep returning becausee of these things, and because she receives considerable long-term relief from her pain every time. ",1
3659,36837,1.0," I am 23 and suffered from back pain for 5 years due to an accident. Dr. Garg is the only &quot;pain management&quot; doctor in Cache Valley. I had three epidural steroid injections all of them didn't help at all. After each failed painful injection he said he would change the medication and that should help but nothing ever helped. I asked him what else we could do and he said that he couldn't help me anymore. He told me at my age I shouldn't have any pain. He won't listen to you and doesn't have a good bedside manner. It is worth it to find another doctor and travel to Salt Lake. The only thing Dr. Garg does is these injections, not &quot;pain management&quot;. There are other doctors out there that will explore many other options out there for you for pain relief. It is worth it to look outside of the valley. Don't waste your time with him.  ",-1
3660,36837,1.0," DR Garge practices as a Pain Management specialist. His main (and only approach I am aware of) is epidural steriod injections. I spent two hours in his office with only 12-15 minutes with him and instantly his conclusion was epidural steriod injections and anti-depressant. He did not seem to be listening to anything I said, beware he appears to have his mind made up before even speaking to you! ",-1

3662,36848,1.0,  ,-1
3663,36848,1.0," Appointment was over 30 min. late. Receptionist did not listen about billing BC/BC of Mass.so I received a bill 4 months latter for 20 minutes of his time and they still insisted they were right. Dr. couldn't even find the PSI report on the blood work. Offered not information about dealing with a hydrocele.  Was not impressed, not recommended! ",-1
3664,36848,1.0," Paid an insane amount of money, just for him to brush me off and tell me that my erectile problems were probably psychological. He knows little to nothing about hormones other than testosterone. Paid/Co-pay:$1600",-1
3665,36848,1.0," I really like Dr Gange.  Often times he is really busy and seems in a hurry , however, he will slow down and talk to me when I have concerns.  I have been seeing him for approximately 8 years.  He has kept my IC undercontrol.  I have had 2 surgeries with him and have had no complications and will be having another surgery next month for something different.  He does know his stuff, and is aware that he does.  But as long as he keeps me going I am happy. ",1
3666,36848,1.0," This doctor did a prostatectomy on me nine years ago and I'm still suffering the consequences of his mistakes today. During the surgery he cut my colon in two places, on the size of a quarter. I ended up with a colostomy bag for a year. During the next three years I had nine procedures to correct his mistakes. Now after having a colonoscopy I find I have to have two more surgeries related to the placement of the colostomy bag. They had to use a pediatric scope to get through the restricted colon and are concerned about a blockage happening. Yes he rid me of cancer but he would not take any responsibility for the years of misery he caused due to his mistake. I would have to agree with the other comments, he is a very arrogant person who thinks he can do no wrong.  ",-1
3667,36848,1.0," Dr. Gange seemed not to sure of himself and going more by what the referring doctor said.  He had me go through needless procedures, and got me worrying myself sick.  His staff was absolutely the rudest people I have ever had the mispleasure of dealing with. ",-1
3668,36848,1.0," He did my husband's vasectomy.  We now have a third child.  Happy to have the child now, but at the time had not planned anymore kids (obviously).  Had to have it redone a 2nd time and stupid us went back to him to redo it.  It was so uncomfortable.  This man is so arrogant.  Said it was his first time ever having to redo one.  But, I know someone else who also has a child after he did his vasectomy.  ",-1
3669,36848,1.0," I cant believe all the bad comments about him. Although he asked me a lot of questions in my appointment, he didn't inform me a whole lot of what would happen, but the surgery went great and he was great to check on my in the hospital. He was also very wonderful with my family and kept in contact with my nurses while i was in the hospital after my surgery. The surgery went perfect and im looking forward to my appointments in the future. The only thing i regret is that my appointments were so quick and it was my fault i didn't ask him everything that was on my mind.  GREAT DOCTOR!!!!!! ",1
3670,36848,1.0, Horrible experience. Tells me I have cancer and has me watch a video that is totally unrelated to my situation. Left his office wondering if life was worth living. Got a second opinion with a careing doctor who gave me hope. Had the surgery several years ago and am happy and healthy today.  ,-1
3671,36848,1.0, His eyes lite up when he found cancer.  His only &quot;second&quot; opinion reference was to his own office.  Glad I left!  Other patients of his office I talked to had bad surgery's.  ,-1
3672,36848,1.0, This staff was probably the rudest I have ever encountered.  I was not impressed with Dr. Gange either.  I would never step foot in this place again. ,-1
3673,36848,1.0, I feel he wouldn't listen to a thing I said. I made a real mistake having him do my surgery.  ,-1
3674,36848,1.0, Dr. Gange DID NOT listen to me regarding my surgery today. I specifficaly asked for a pediatric stint after they went to take care of the kidney sone and he didn''t put one in. instead he gave me and adult stint and now I am peeing my pants and bleeding efery time. I have tried the adult stints in the past and have also had a bpedeatric stint put in. the only one i never had any problens with was the pedeatric one. ,-1
3675,36848,1.0," Not only a great doc, but very passionate about his work. ",1
3676,36865,1.0," He is great, very quick appointments, I hate spending forever waiting, so I appreciate him not making me sit forever in the room.  He delivered my son and he was very caring.  His nurses are great and his billing department is extremely helpful and willing to work with you. ",1
3677,36865,1.0," Really great, super nice, excellent bedside manner.  He delivered my last 2 kids. ",1
3678,36868,1.0," Doctor Gaufin, was very helpful and understanding with my situation and helped me understand what would be in my best interest to help my situation. Most of the staff was friendly the receptionist could be a little snippy at times, at times there could be a 45 minute to an hour wait before you would see the doctor, I understand that he is very good in his perfession and alot of people need to see him, and when I did see him he was very understanding and helpful and kind.  Yes defefinetly I would recommend him to others, he is a GREAT DOCTOR!!! ",1
3679,36868,1.0," First went to Dr. Gaufin 10 years ago. Told me when my neck got bad enough to come back and he would fix it.  He did exactly that.  Told me I would need another in a few years, went 5 years and again I recieved possitive results.  My son had a brain cyst.  He referred him for a second opinion at the U and they confirmed exactly what Dr. Gaufin had in mind. Took my Mom into him and again he was right on.  Dr. Gaufin did my husbands corpral tunnel surgery. Although that is a minor surgery for Dr. Gaufin he treated him the same as he did my son. Very detailed and through.  Matt Badger is just as good in his follow ups.  I would not hestitate to refer anyone to Dr. Gaufin or Matt Badger.  ",1
3680,36868,1.0," Dr. Gaufin is such an intelligent, kind, helpful, skilled surgeon!  He really explained everything about my surgery and quieted all my fears.  I am so grateful for all the time he took with me.  I did a lot of research about him before my appointment so I knew that he had fabulous credentials and is staying current on all his medical knowledge.  Everyone I asked gave him a great recommendation.  He is such a kind, caring doctor.  He told me that I would feel better after my surgery and I was so happy that I had no pain deep in my back only the incision pain.  I couldn't believe that the pain was gone!!  I was so relieved and I am so glad I had the surgery done.  My family is very grateful too.  If I had known that I would feel this good six months later I would have had the surgery sooner.  I really appreciate all that Dr. Gaufin and his staff did for me.  He is fantastic!!  If you are having back pain and need surgery please do yourself a favor and go visit Dr.  Gaufin!!  He is awesome! ",1
3681,36868,1.0," Surgeon made up his mind before talking even meeting with me.  He suggested I get a 2nd opinion @ &quot;The U&quot; even though I told him my insurance doesn't cover it. He dictated the liabilities in front of me &amp; said, &quot;it could take up to 5-6 years to feel better.&quot; He definitely wasn't a personable guy, didn't answer &#63;'s, etc. I Left feeling pretty discouraged, not having any other options, and/or any referrals. I will not refer ANYONE to his practice!! ",-1
3682,36868,1.0," Dr. Gaufin is wonderful! He was my doctor when I was diagnosed with a small brain tumor. He was very helpful in letting me know all my options, talking about my worries and concerns, and giving me the out look for my future. He was very caring and did a great job on the surgery. Something that I love about Dr. Gaufin is that at the end of each of your appontments, while you sit there, he will tape record what  you talked about and your plan of action and they they type it up and send it to you so you always know and can remember what you learned and talked about without you have to take notes while being emotionally strained about your health! He cares about everyone he sees and will take all the time you need to answer your questions! ",1
3683,36868,1.0, Dr. Gaufin and Matt Badger were absolutely wonderful. I was at the point of not being able to walk and they scheduled the surgery quickly and did such a great job. I now have no lumbar pain and feel great. And they are so friendly and interested in their patients.  ,1
3684,36869,1.0," Dr. Chris - couldn't say his last name :) - is a great guy!  He was very funny too, helping me relax, and did a wonderful job on the anesthesia.  Thanks Dr.  G! ",1
3685,36869,1.0, not very good ,-1
3686,36872,1.0," I seldom go to the doctor, and when I have I hate the sterile and impersonal feel. Dr Gay is the first that I have felt comfortable with.  He is helpful, engaging, and friendly.   I highly recommend him ",1
3687,36872,1.0," Generally don't go to the Dr (Perhaps 5 times in 10 years).  3 of the times has been with this Dr.  He is very friendly, and engaging; it feels as if he wants to help.  Strongly recommended.  ",1
3688,36872,1.0," Love this doctor! Appt is exactly the time they state, no waiting.  very knowledgeable and very friendly. Does not feel like going to the doctor.  Your time is just as important as theirs.  ",1
3689,36872,1.0,  ,1
3690,36877,1.0," Didn't like this guy at all.  While delivering our child, he made jokes about sex and various medical procedures.  Awful, awful bedside manners.  ",-1
3691,36877,1.0," I, like many others, had a bad experience with Dr. Gamette. I will not ever allow him to deliver my children.  I found him to have poor bedside manner and old fashioned, out dated methods. I have two other friends that also had similar, negative experiences with him. ",-1
3692,36877,1.0," I had one of my prenatal appointments with him. He was very nice and funny. My only negative remark was that he got out the dopler to hear the baby's hb and used it for two seconds. As any pregnant woman knows, you just love to go to these appointments just to hear the hb. But after my husband asked &quot;is that it&#63; Can we hear it again&#63;&quot; He was actually really nice about it and went on to tell us funny things about babies heartbeats. Really liked him. ",1
3693,36877,1.0, We really enjoyed our appt with Dr. Gamette. He worked hard to make me feel at ease and answer all of my questions. He explained everything he did and gave me some good advice for staying healthy. I didn't feel rushed or like he was anything other than friendly and interested in my pregnancy. Paid/Co-pay:$182,1
3694,36877,1.0," dr gamette, was awsome he is very fun person, and helped with my c-section, he came to visit me serveral times in the hospital (he wasnt my normal doctor) he speaks his mind. and he has a fun humor.  ",1
3695,36877,1.0," I love Dr Gamette, he delivered my son and was very knowledgeable. I felt totally safe even though i had a very difficult labor. He has excellent bedside manner. I feel that he has had enough experience he could handle anything. I highly recommend!! ",1
3696,36877,1.0," I Loved Dr Gammette, I felt he was very knowledgeable and had great bedside manner. ",1
3697,36877,1.0," Avoid Dr. Gamette. He is rude, unethical, and pompous.  ",-1
3698,36880,1.0, Very knowledgeable. Takes as much time with you as you need to explain you problem. Makes several suggestions in ways to help. Doesn't leave any stone unturned.  ,1
3699,36880,1.0, Dr Gardner is the best. He did my nose surgery and I wouldn't go anywhere else if I needed facial surgery.  ,1
3700,36885,1.0," Dr. Gardner is great! He performed brain surgery on me and removed a tumor. I had surgery less than 2 days after he found out about my tumor. He really cares about you. I went on vacation for a week and he called me after I got back and the first thing he asked was how my trip went. I did not have a referral when I went to him, but I'm glad I did because he's great! I do have to wait a bit in the waiting room for my appointments, but usually Dr. Gardner is in surgery and gets to me as soon as he can. ",1
3701,36885,1.0, He did an excellent job on my surgery which has provided great relief of my pain.  He took his time to do the surgery right.  My anatomy was a bit different requiring an adjustment in his approach.  I was also surprised how easy the recovery was. ,1
3702,36885,1.0," I could not ask for a better doc the Doc. Paul Gardner not only did he do my mother shunt surgery, he was always willing to answer question and return phone calls. He is not a doc trying to fill you up on useless medication or want to see you back every two weeks just to see what else he can do. Dr. Paul Gardner is one of the best if you ask me. I would refer anyone to him. He doesn't think your a number, he knows you as a person. He is a really down to earth, knowledgeable person. His office staff slack a little Knowledge in that department, but i really don't know if its really up to him. Since there are like three other doc in the same place. I give Doc. Paul Gardner a 10! I want to say thanks to him, for helping my mother. Thanks Dr.! Paid/Co-pay:$50000",1
3703,36885,1.0," Very nice doctor and very educated , Done my sons brain surgery and he is doing great. Finally found a great doctor that treats us good and knows what hes doing. Took my son in a hurry and believed what we told him. We appreciate him greatly.  God bless him ",1
3704,36885,1.0," Dr. Gardner was nice enough when I finally got in his office almost two hours after my appointment.  The office staff insulate him from the phone, and they also lie about where he is.  They said he had an emergency, but when I asked him about it he didn't know anything about any emergency. They also lost all my paperwork.  ",1
3705,36887,2.0,  ,-1
3706,36887,2.0,  ,-1
3707,36889,1.0," Very helpful and friendly.  He knows his stuff and if he doesn't he will find it out for you.  He is straight to the point - which I like. He spends time with you, thus, the punctuality for the next appt may suffer a wee bit, but he probably spends the time with every patient as well. ",1
3708,36889,1.0," Just wanted to let everyone that may read this that Dr. Gardner is absolutely the best, most honest, most compassionate, and most current physician i have ever met.  His demeanor is often very subdued and straight with you, but i appreciate this when it comes to my health.  I referred all my family members to him.  My brother that had cancer... well, he saved his life over a dozen times when other doctors had given up on him.  While he wasn't &quot;perfect&quot; in every decision (who is&#63;&#63;), he never quits on you.  I saw this especially with my brother's care, who was on his deathbed many times.  Koodos to this great doctor.  He never gives up and searches until he finds a solution that works for your health.  He'll hardly mention religion, but it's nice to have a physician that expertly uses science, but also deeply trusts in God.  Thank you Dr. Gardner for your excellent quality care.  Love the new, beautiful office too, and the fact that you are right next door to a hosptital... even better.  ",1
3709,36889,1.0," Thought he was quick to judge and actually accused me of Doctor shopping, anyone knowing me knows that is not true..would not recommend him to my worst enemy. Not someone to see of you have a chronic illness, I feel like he couldnt get rid of me quick enough.  ",-1
3710,36889,1.0," Dr. Kevin Gardner is the Finest Family Practice Physician I have ever had. He is knowlegeable, Compassionate,and responsive to his patient's needs. ",1
3711,36889,1.0," I got sick when I was 14 years old. I am now 20. Dr. Gardner diagnosed me with Lupus a few years ago and is the only doctor that would actually help me. I went to countless doctors and specialist to figure out why I was so sick. every single one of them told me that basically I'm making it up for attention. After a year of disappointment and loosing hope of getting better we tried going to Dr. Gardner after one visit he said sounds like you might have lupus. I spent many days in his doctor's office basically getting test ran making sure that that's what I had, which it was. He doesn't just give you meds and sends you out the door like most. His staff is great, every time I came in they would make a sign that said &quot;Angie's room&quot; and hang it about the door for me. Dr. Gardner has a great sense of humor and always makes you feel comfortable. I am so thankful for him and there is no other doctor I would go to.  I highly suggest him!! :) ",1
3712,36889,1.0," Dr. G has been my doc for about 5 years he is an amazing dr. he cares about me and my family he has always helped me, took his time and never threw meds at me to get me to leave. He also figured out what was wrong with my sister when she got sick with Lupus no other dr. even looked at her enought to know. He is the best doctor i have ever been too and his staff has always been great!!!!! ",1
3713,36889,1.0," There was only one lady at the front that at least played the part of a great receptionist. That was it. And, because I had so many things wrong with me, they actually gave me a notice to find a new doctor. His nurse was rude & lazy-gone now, but I have a much better doc now and things are finally getting done. I agree with the other commenter-STAY AWAY- He'll stab ya in the back! ",-1
3714,36889,1.0," He spent no longer than 3 minutes with me, charged me the cost of an extensive visit, he was rude, had no interest in anything I had to say about physical problems. Just wanted to get rid of me. Office staff equally as rude ab/nd unfriendly. One of the worst physicians I have ever encountered. Stay away from him. Paid/Co-pay:$18500",-1
3715,36890,2.0," MediCruiser is absolutely the best clinic I have ever been to.  The physicians are excellent and the staff is wonderful. They really believe in Care, not just Cure! Paid/Co-pay:$85",1
3716,36892,1.0," Dr. Garr is personable, gentle, and very knowledgable.  He takes the time to do a real diagnosis and he uses the latest technology.  I had a crown in a single visit and it's the best experience I've had with major dental work.  His staff are cheerful, gentle, and accurate with their work.  His Hygienist is gentle and thorough.  I liked the TV's on the ceiling and the effort they go to make it a comfortable experience.  I would definitly recommend this office.  ",1
3717,36892,1.0," Although he was very thorough about checking every little thing, he wanted to fill stuff that had no business filling. I went to another Dentist a few months later and there was no problem with the teeth that Dr. Garr thought I should fix.  I felt as if I was paying extra for the stupid TV that he has in the ceiling that you really cant watch cause his arm is in the way.  ",1
3718,36892,1.0," I love Dr. Garr! He is so helpful and actually listens to my concerns and really cares what I think regarding my oral health. His office staff is amazing and make me feel so welcome. The office is bright, clean and up to date. Dr.  Garr is very easy on the eyes, too:) ",1
3719,36894,1.0, Dr. Gardiner is a great doctor. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. He takes the time to thoroughly answer any question my wife and have had concerning our baby. ,1
3720,36894,1.0," Dr. Gardiner is exceptionally kind and knowledgable. He is generous with his time, respectful of differing opinions, and willing to work with parents. He is an excellent doctor in every way.  ",1
3721,36894,1.0," It's easy to get in for appointments, the staff is great, and Dr Gardiner is fantastic with the kids.   I'd recommend him to anyone! ",1
3722,36894,1.0, Art is a great doctor and one of the nicest people.  He really takes his time to do his evaluation.  I cannot say enough good stuff about this doctor and would recommend him to everyone. ,1
3723,36894,1.0, Dr. Gardiner is wonderful! He is always helpful and he treats our kids like they are his own! You never feel like he's rushing you or just prescribing your kids something to &quot;see&quot; if that works. He knows what he is doing and actually knows what is going on with your kid. His nurses are amazing as well! Friendly and knowledgeable! ,1
3724,36894,1.0, I love this doctor. He is very caring and treats his patients as if they were his own. Very supportive. He goes out of his way to find out what is wrong if he is not sure. Very nice and approachable. I wish there was more drs. like him ! ! ! I was very sad when my daughter was to old to go to him anymore ,1
3725,36896,1.0," An excellent physician, Dr. Garg has performed 3 colonoscopies on me over recent years.  He is efficient and thorough, finding even the minutest problem.  Each time was 100% PAINLESS. Once I arrived, I had to wait a little for my procedure, but that's only because he takes the time with each patient to get it exactly right. I was glad to wait. ",1
3726,36896,1.0," Dr. Garg did a colonoscopy on my wife. Most painful experience of her life. Advised us that she could not be put to sleep for procedure, which I have subsequently learned not to be true. Refused additional medication for pain when my wife asked. Other than that, he was very polite and professional. I would see him for follow up care, just not again for that procedure.  ",1
3727,36899,0.0, I thought Dr. Garg was a great pediatrician. She was always respectful and appropriate with my children! She is very down-to-earth and thorough. She knows what to watch for and what to do when a problem arises. She was able to recognize a cognitive problem with my child and helped us with resources and referrals that he needed.  She was also quick getting sick kids in and had a great staff that was just as good with Mom as with the kids! ,1
3728,36899,0.0," Dr. Garg provides perfunctory answers to parents' questions and does not comment on why she prescribes the treatments she does.  I found her approach to be a little too aggressive in situations where less invasive options were acceptable or even preferable, such as steroid cream for eczema, and hormones for mild labial adhesion.  She also has a very negative view of out-of-hospital births. ",-1
3729,36903,0.0," I had the most positive experience with a dr.  during one of the worst days of my life. Thank you, dr. Gainer. ",1
3730,36903,0.0," Very helpful, knowledgeable, and spent a considerable amount of time discussing my concerns. Office staff was also very helpful and prompt. ",1
3731,36903,0.0, This doctor has the worst bedside manner and shows no emotion in what she does. I would suggest finding another doctor who is emotionally invested in his/her patients. ,-1
3732,36905,1.0," Excellent eye doctor, he is very nice and he knows his stuff. ",1
3733,36907,0.0, Love her and office staff.  Incredibly knowlegeable and kind. Very skillful.  ,1
3734,36909,2.0, Great office all around. They four of them do a great job. ,1
3735,36911,1.0," DR. Nielson is the best OBGYN in the world. Cares, listens, answers questions, doesn't rush you, calms you down, makes you feel comfortable, all the best. The same goes for his nurse. Front desk: doesn't care, just goes through motions, and billing: don't even bother talking to her. If you so much as have a question she will tell you to look for another doctor if you don't like her billing. She does that because she knows Dr. Nielson is great and people won't leave, but she is so unprofessional, inconsiderate, and rude to patients.  ",1
3736,36911,1.0, Dr. Neilson is amazing however his front office and billing staff is far from. ,1
3737,36911,1.0," I switched to Dr. Neilson because of insurance and am soooo glad I did.  He has been so nice, and helpful so far in my pregnancy! ",1
3738,36911,1.0, Dr. Neilson is the best Gyn I've ever been to.  He comes in before the exam just to chat and see if you have any questions or concerns.  He is the only Dr. that has taken the time to really answer my questions.  He's super nice and never makes you feel rushed.  ,1
3739,36911,1.0," I've been a patient of Dr. Neilson's for over 10 years. He is truly a wonderful, caring physician who always has your best interest at heart. He delivered all three of my children and jumped through hoops to be there for me during those deliveries.  My husband also feels very comfortable and confident with him as our physician because of his great demeanor and vast knowledge.  I have recommended him to all of my family, friends and co-workers. I know of at least six of them who have been going to him for several years too.  He is sincerely the best physician I've ever had.  ",1
3740,36911,1.0," He is the best OB in Salt Lake! When I had my baby, many of the nurses in the hospital commented that he was their doctor too. He is laid-back, friendly, and makes you feel comfortable from the first visit. I have recommended him to everyone I know and would never want to have a baby without him as my doctor. Even in a crisis, he is really experienced and makes you feel like he knows exactly what to do and is capable of taking perfect care of you. He also called personally to check on me several times. And his nurse is so sweet and wonderful! Dr.  Nielson is the best!! WE LOVE HIM!!!!!!! ",1
3741,36911,1.0," After seeing too many fertility doctors, I found a regular OB I got pregnant. He is a very good doctor and always in a good mood. Very helpful, although you never really talk to him on the phone. You usually talk to his nurse, but you can ask for him.  ",1
3742,36922,1.0," I love, love, love Dr. Mark Naisbitt.  He does a wonderful, competant job with anesthesia and has a wonderful, caring manner. ",1
3743,36923,0.0," Is very thorough.  She was behind but I was told that isnt uncommon for her since she takes her time with her patients.  She listened to me and took the time to get the the root of my problems.  She did test and we found out that I dont have asthma but severe acid reflux.  I was misdiagnosed w/ asthma and was trying to manage breathing problems (from acid reflux)since I was 12!  She has continuted to follow up with me even though I have no Lung or sleeping problmes wich are her area of expertise.  Excellent physician.  Very compasionate and caring.  Plus, extremely knowledgable on many diseases.  Found out through her that acid reflux is more likely caused by a disease that I have (mixed connective tissue disease) and she scheduled appointments with other doctors  for me to follow up with.  Unlike many other docs I have seen she has never dropped the ball.  She really does care about her patients. I am extremely grateful to have found her and happy to recommend her. ",1
3744,36929,2.0," 5 Stars.  Great doc. My new crown looks so real my orthodontist used the wrong bonding material for my bracket when I got braces.  I guess porcelain requires a different glue, the orthodontist had to look at the xray to confirm it was porcelain because it looked so real!  Thanks for replacing my tooth with a perfectly natural one.  If another dental professional can't even tell I had a crown, then it's got to look good!  Thanks.  ",1
3745,36932,1.0," Dr Naisbitt was would not listen to or do anything my wife or I asked. My wife had an IUD placed 4 weeks after having our baby which it has now been in for 3 months.  Since the day it was put in, she has been having heavy bleeding, hot flashes, migraines, extreme fatigue, and irritability.  I requested that he take the IUD out several times which he kept telling me how my WIFE'S OWN body was working.  He kept trying to sell me his diet pills when she weighs 110 lbs.  He then prescribed a pill birth control, AND NEVER TOOK OUT THE IUD.  We had already gone to the ER and had blood work done which showed she was not Anemic but that the hormones from the IUD were causing the problem.  Dr Naisbitt told us that the pill would help with the bleeding.  I continually asked him to take out the IUD which he would not.  NOT SATISFIED ",-1
3746,36932,1.0," Jed has been my doctor for about 12 years he as delivered 3 of my children and is wonderful,yes you have to wait along time most appoitments but I feel it is worth it,anytime I ha a problem he was there for me and he is in my opinion one of the best doctors around.I am sorry that I hear he is going to retire at the end of the year. He will be missed ",1
3747,36932,1.0," Jed is a fantastic doctor. He saw me through 2 of my pregnancies, Ivy, in 2004, who died 3 days later from SIDS. He was amazing and helpful, and comforting to me in my time of loss. Not only did he send flowers, he wrote off my bill, and called several times to check on me. My pregnacy following Ivy's death was a very stressful, emotional one and he helped me through it, all of my calls and &quot;emergency&quot; office visits, he was kind and patient, and did the best he could to make me feel at ease. I LOVE Jed, and reccommend anyone to him. It is true that their office is very busy at times, there were times I waited over an hour to be seen and once I was even forgotten! But the quality of care I received at Circle of Life Womens Center made up for it.  ",1
3748,36932,1.0," I've read some of the comments and some where not that favorable for him.  I have been going to Jed for 15yrs he delivered all 4 of my kids and I love him as a doctor.  I started with him when he was a Mckay Dee and his staff then was wonderful, they where the nicest lady you could have ever known, sometimes when I go in there I still get to see the ones that havn't retired.  I have a lot of problems in my pregs and they where wonderful to me.  However the young girls that help out now in his new office are not that great, but I still think that Jed is a great doctor and I trust he completely.  ",1
3749,36932,1.0, He is excellent! I wouldnt go to anyone else for my next pregnancy and delivery.  Sometimes he was 15-25 minutes late for the appointments but he is worth it. He is very calm and quiet spoken wich is good because then I didnt get upset or freaked out about any little thing that happened during my pregnancy. My  1st baby boy came two weeks early and was delivered vaginally with no tearing for me.  I believe that is partially due to dr. naisbitts experience.  I would recommend him to all my friends and family.  ,1
3750,36932,1.0," Excellent. He may seem very hurried, but that usually means everything is fine. If your pregnancy is remotely risky he makes all the time in the world for you, even coming in on days off and late hours. If he can't fit you in he makes sure to find you another doctor that is just as good and most suited to your situation.  ",1
3751,36932,1.0," NOT VBAC FRIENDLY.  I ended up with 3 c-sect because of him.  I am now in GA and will be attempting a Vaginal birth after 3 c-sections.  He convinced me I needed to be induced with my 1st and the result was a miserable c-section.  With my 2nd he pulled out all the stops to convince me a VBAC is &quot;too dangerous&quot;, quoted me bogus statistics.  ",-1
3752,36932,1.0," I argee that Dr Naisbitt can seem hurried.  But, when it really counts he is there for you.  I lost my first child at 7 months from complications that could have been caught, but where not by another doctor.  Jed took me under his wing with my second and third child and made sure they got here safely.  I was scheduled to see him ever other day at the end of my preganacy and he came in every time.  Sunday's, day's off and all.  I  dare say my girls may not be here if it weren't for that mans care. ",1
3753,36932,1.0," He was great the first time I saw him in the hospital at the start of my miscarridge in 2000. However, he quickly passed me off to his midwife at the time and never saw me again till he had to perform my D & C at a later date. Luckly for me his midwife Guy Cox was an extreamly understanding and caring person. I now only see Guy for all my health concerns, he now has his own practice. Also, I have had nothing but problems with Jed's office staff. They sent me a bill two years after the service was provided and never sent it to my insurance, it is now in collections because his office refused to send it to my insurance after I gave them the information 6 times.  ",1
3754,36932,1.0, The best doctor anyone could ask for!!! Through all of my families and friends pregnancys he has done fantastic!!!! GO TO HIM!!!!:) ,1
3755,36932,1.0, I absolutely adore Dr. Naisbitt. I had a very high risk pregnancy with my first child. He caught the disease I had very early and saved me and my daughters life. I owe him the world. so when I found out that I was having another baby a few years ago I would go to no one else but jed. He always answered all my questions and really helped me not to be so scared. I see Dr.  Naisbitt once a year every year! I would recommend him to anyone! ,1
3756,36932,1.0, He is such a great Doctor.  I had three kids after a miscarriage of my first pregnancy. and I was always worried and scared if I was going to miscarry again. He understood my concerns and made me feel so much better. ,1
3757,36932,1.0, I had a very hard time trying to conceive with medical help.  He was very aggressive when it came to fertility. My daughter is here because Jed didn't waste time or effort. ,1
3758,36932,1.0," Dr Jed delivered my 3 kids. Was a FANTASTIC Dr. He helped make sure I was comfortable durning all pregnancies since I carried them right out front and was HUGE. Any problem that arose, he addressed promptly.  He did what he could to make me more comfortable with illnesses without hurting my babies. He was able to detect club foot on my son during an ultrasound which really helped soften the blow on his delivery.  I am now pregnant with my 4th and live 2000 miles away from him and can't find a Dr like him.  We are actually thinking of going back to Utah to have him deliver me as the doctors here don't have the care and compassion he has.  ",1
3759,36932,1.0, I loved having Dr. Naisbitt as my OB.  He delivered my first baby when the midwife had a problem.  I recently had a baby girl and I choose him as my OB.  He was great and I will definitly see him again.  He is the best! ,1
3760,36932,1.0, Jed is GREAT! There is nothing else to it.  first OB I find that I feel 100% comfortable with he answers all my questions he is personable and he is just wonderful.  I've heard bad rumore about him but those rumors have not changed my mind...He was just too good to me to believe everything I've heard and even if they were true He is still the best OB I've ever had.  ,1
3761,36932,1.0, I absolutely loved going to see Dr. Naisbitt. He is such a great doctor! He is so friendly and personable. He will definately be delivering all of my babies. ,1
3762,36932,1.0, I think that Jed is a wonderful doctor! I left my old OB when I was 6 months pregnant with my second because I felt that my needs weren't being met. Jed has been so helpful and would sit in there all day and answer all my questions if I asked him to. He cares about his patients and there babies.  He will be delivering my 3rd child here in a couple weeks and I will most definatly go back to him for #4 ,1
3763,36932,1.0," Jed has delivered the majority of the babies born in my family. Thanks to him, both my baby and I are alive and well. He was on his way back to Ogden from a Las Vegas Convention when I went into labor at 33 weeks. He was scheduled for a c-section that afternoon. The doctor on call said to give me a shot to stop my labor without coming to talk or see me. I was a high risk pregnancy from my last c-section from a different doctor who had sewn my uterus up bad. I told this to the staff at the hospital but they did not listen to me. Jed called into the hospital on his way from the airport and asked if his patient was there. They said yes and I was there and was in labor for about 4 hours and they were just going to give me a shot and send me home. He told them not to touch me with a needle and he would evaluate when he got there. My contractions were off the chart when I got to the hospital and I thought I was being ripped open. He delivered my daughter first. Thank you Jed for everything. ",1
3764,36932,1.0," I went to Jed for my 2nd pregnancy, and I highly recommend him! He answers all of your questions and provided excellent care. If we needed to talk to him, night or day, he was there. We will definately return to his care for all future pregnancies. ",1
3765,36932,1.0, Jed Naisbitt delivered our beautiful baby girl. we enjoyed having him as our OBGYN.  ,1
3766,36932,1.0, I think Dr. Naisbitt is actually the best physician on the planet! ,1
3767,36932,1.0, Never gets his facts straight. Told me my baby would be dead if I had the flu. She was born with a condition caused by the flu that I had at that time. ,-1
3768,36932,1.0, I would just like to say that Dr. Jed Naisbitt is a great man. He helped my husband and I with our trying to have a baby. He knew the problem and told us what to do and it worked. ,1
3769,36938,1.0, Very friendly.  Always behind appointment times.  NOt always through and causes mistakes that have to be corrected.  ,1
3770,36938,1.0," Took over practice after I fully paid, then recommended an expensive appliance which got the job done - charged me zero! Very well informed with modern orthodontic practice and procedures. I highly recommend him to everyone. ",1
3771,36941,0.0," The previous poster obviously has an issue with Dr. Nagle.  I should point out that a doctor has a professional responsibility to report something he/she deems suspect.  Having said that, Dr. Nagel is the best pediatrician I have ever had for my children.  She caught a tumor in my son's ear that literally saved his life.  My youngest has had many health problems and she has been on top of these things.  I could not ask for a better pediatrician or human being. ",1
3772,36941,0.0," I was in this office a few months ago to get my daughter immunized for school.  I came in with her and my 3 yr old son.      My son was a handful and had a lot of energy that day.  While in the office with Dr Nagle, my son hit my daughter. I firmly grabbed his arm and started talking to him about the fact that is is wrong to hit your sister and how we do not behave this way.   I am military, and my husband is military and believe in firm discipline.    Dr. Nagle immediately offered her personal opinion and told me my son was exhibiting all the signs of A.D.D.  How would she know when I had only been there a few minutes&#63; The conversation immediately turned hostile from Dr.Nagle and she told me to be careful or she would report me to DFS.      3 1/2 months later I get a visit from DFS for suspected child abuse.  I am told this complaint was  filed as anonymous     I got an attorney and have subpoena'd the records.She will be getting a lawsuit from us in the near future. ",-1
3773,36948,1.0," My family has with Dr. Nemetz for 15 years. He has always been courteous and willing to answer any of our questions. He is very direct and very helpful which I appreciate. I trust his judgement and is a very articulate surgeon, after healing I had a very tiny scar which has now become unnoticeable. He will be as informative as you wish. His staff are prompt and have been very polite and friendly. I had pneumonia 2002 and he quickly put me on a correct medication which quickly cleared up my pneumonia.  ",1
3774,36948,1.0, I have a chronic illness and this doctor tried to help me but when it become obvious his treatments weren't working his bedside mannerisms became almost defensive. He in a round about way hinted that he thought I was lying to him about my symptoms.  Epic Fail! ,-1
3775,36948,1.0, Seems knowledgable in all things my family asks.  Thorough.  ,1
3776,36952,1.0, ONE AWESOME AND UNOWLEDGEABLE DOC!! He listens and respects! ,1
3777,36952,1.0," Davis Family Physicians is one of the better group of doctors in Davis County.  Their staff are very easy to work with, and the doctors truly care about your condition or ailment.  I highly recommend these guys! ",1
3778,36957,1.0," This doctor is horrible beyond words. I went to him back in January complaining of dizziness, and my nose and arm all tingling for weeks. I had been advised by an out-of-state doctor friend, that these could be symptoms of MS or diabetes and that I should see a doctor to get it checked. Dr. Nabi didn't listen to my heart, my lungs, check my reflexes or anything else. The only way he touched me was to look in my ears to see if they were infected.  He told me that my nose was tingling due to it being cold outside (when I pointed out it was happening on a trip to warm California he shrugged), that my arm was tingling due to a pulled muscle in my arm (which I didn't have!), and I was dizzy because I was dehydrated. I specifically asked if MS was a concern.  He told me &quot;When looking at your symptoms MS is the furthest thing from my mind.&quot;   He didn't TRY to even look into anything! I went for a second opinion. Lots of tests and 4 months later, I was told by an MS specialist that I have MS.  ",-1
3779,36962,1.0," I took my child to see this man after the clinic he worked for was suggested by our insurance provider.  I explained numerous symptoms to Chadd about my sons issues:  headaches, pain in the lower back, painful urination, lethargic behavior, chronic pain which would last for hours throughout EVERY night since his immunizations as an infant in which his feet would literally curl up underneath themselves.  His explanation for this was first, it must be my sons behavioral disorder. My son has been in pain since infancy. Chadd went on to state that it is from a withdrawal.  If a mother is a heavy user of medication a child with go through withdrawals and that is why he is in pain.  I'm the mother and I don't even use tylenol, let alone anything else.  He stated there was nothing he would do.  There were no tests to find out why my son is having trouble breathing through his nostrals for YEARS.  He was unwilling to help &amp; acted as if we were an annoyance and he just wanted us to leave. ",-1
3780,36962,1.0, I don't know who much I have paid. I was basically given to Chadd Nelson after Dr. Harpe left. I have tried and tried to like this guy and to trust this guy but I just can't. He is a conceded **** to his clints. Just because your a doctor does not give you the right to treat people like they are so much lower then you. I will work and having him removed from tanner clinic or may be I just start going to ogden  clinic. ,-1
3781,36962,1.0," I was referred to this doctor because he was a specialist. When I went to him he treated me like nothing was wrong, in spite of him having lab results that said otherwise. I was referred to him by two other doctors who had reviewed my labs and felt I needed to see someone that could diagnose me better. He was unwilling to even entertain the idea that maybe I had a low thyroid, going through menopause or low adrenals could be the cause. He was unwilling to submit me for further testing because he doesnt believe in Epsteins Barr or Chronic Fatigue as being a true disorder/disease. He in other words said it was all in my head and there was nothing wrong with me. I told him that visiting him was a waste of my time and money and he became very defensive. I asked told him people actually pay him big  bucks to give them a 50 cent answer&#63; what a joke. I told my regular doctor what had happened they will never use him again.  The man is a joke!!! ",-1
3782,36962,1.0," Chadd Nelson is an abusive, hot tempered, easily agitated, uncaring doctor.  He seems to be particularily neglectful and disrespecful to elderly patients.  He exhibits discriminatory behavior towards patients for various reasons.  He acts as though he is superior and smarter, and what you have to say cannot possible to right, true or accurate.  He will REFUSE to listen.  He only wants to hear the sound of his own voice.  I took my elderly mother to him for care and he treated her so badly, keeping his back to her the entire time and never once speaking directly to her.  When he found out that she had a criminal record from MANY years ago, he suddenly became abusive and hot tempered toward us.  He suddenly didn't want to treat this elderly woman or listen to me and would not help us.  He refused to properly evaluate and test my mother so he could give her a diagnosis.  Instead he just said he didn't know anything about her and would not help any further.  He is abusive and heartless.  ",-1
3783,36964,1.0," Dr. Nash has helped me alot. He really cares about his patients. He asks about other areas of your life because of the effect they have on your health. And even with all the patients and responsibilities he has, he remembers you and what is going on in your life. It really impressed me that he remembered details about my life. You will receive his advice and his opinion without feeling forced or guilty. He is professional but still human. I recently moved to a different state and really miss having a doctor that I know I can trust, who respects me and knows me. Paid/Co-pay:$25",1
3784,36964,1.0, Dr Nash is a very compassionate person.  He also saved my life 5 years ago when I had staff/septic.  I like that if he doesn't know what to do then he isn't afraid to find someone that can help.  He has a great laugh and takes good time with his patients.   Thank you ,1
3785,36964,1.0, Dr. Nash is very compassionate. He has a great sense of humor but knows when to be serious. He has provided me with excellent medical care and took wonderful care of my wife when she was dying from breast cancer. I really appreciate him. ,1
3786,36965,0.0," The secretary is very rude.  It took several days to get a call returned, not a good way to run a business.  The secretary was very abrupt on the phone.  She made me feel like they were doing me a favor instead of treating me as a potential customer. ",-1
3787,36965,0.0, very knowledgeable in his specialty. He helped my son deal with the fact of having Aspbergers Syndrom tremendously.  Best choice we made! ,1
3788,36972,1.0," Just don't bother, this man is ridiculous. I would never refer him to anyone nor will i return. He does more harm than good, and since he doesn't know his stuff, you better know your stuff or you are his next guinea pig. ",-1
3789,36972,1.0," Dr Neuman accused me, in front of my teen-aged daughter, of mismanaging my her treatment and very rudely told me because of that he would no longer treat her. I was looking for support and was very disappointed with him. This was during a time of extreme crisis in my daughter's life. I would not recommend him.  ",-1
3790,36972,1.0," We really liked Dr. Neuman so much!! We did not find him to be at all indifferent! Rather, he is an excellent listener who really hones in on the situation. Yes, he is casual and understated - that is his style. He has a very dry wit and is very perceptive and likeable. We wholeheartedly recommend him!! ",1
3791,36972,1.0," A bit impersonal, seems disinterested. If you're looking for a connection of any kind, you'll be disappointed. However if you just desire prescriptions, he is a pro. ",1
3792,36972,1.0," His laid back demeanor sometimes can be deceiving, it makes him look apathetic. Not enough questions are asked. Paid/Co-pay:$15",1
3793,36972,1.0," Dr. Neuman has been very helpful for my son, who takes a few different medications that have to be carefully balanced. His laid back demeanor is balanced with professionalism. I would highly recommend him.  ",1
3794,36972,1.0," Dr. Neuman is a very good psychiatrist. He listens very well. I believe, however, that Dr. Neuman's strongest point is his nearly perfect knowledge of pharmacology. ",1
3795,36973,1.0," We just moved to the Layton area and needed a new dentist. I went to  Dr Neville for the first time today and he was wonderful. I was a little early for my appointment and even then they took me right back. no wait time at all! His staff was so nice and personable and Dr Neville himself tried to get to know us as people instead of just a mouth. He and his staff made sure I had all of my questions answered and were very knowledgeable. He is younger than I expected, but he sure knows his stuff! Unfortunately I have to go back for a filling, but I have complete confidence that he will do a great job. ",1
3796,36973,1.0, He is so good with children and very good all around.  He does everything he can to make our family feel comfortable.  He is also very professional and does great work.  ,1
3797,36976,1.0," I agree with the other two posts about how horrible this doctor is.He is so rude. He has an awful bedside manner. He was rude everytime i came in alone for my dr visits , when my husband was there he entire personality changed.He is also very arrogant. I saw him in Utah county, i got a letter saying he was moving to west valley city. I hope you guys have better luck with this man.I think the three positive remarks were probably from his staff. I even had a lady in my ward tell me had yelled at her during her pregnancy. I would stay far away from this dr.  ",-1
3798,36976,1.0," This doctor does not care about the patient and has horrible bed side manner.  Once he came into my prenatal appointment singing Scarlet Pimpernel, spouted out my stats, and then left without actually talking to me.  Most of his appointments were rushed.  He gave me an episiotomy without asking me, and didn't listen to me when I said I was feeling pain while he stitched me up.  I would not recommend this doctor to deliver your child unless you want someone who is not a good listener, uncaring, and arrogant. ",-1
3799,36976,1.0, I have been going to Dr Nelson for 18 years now. He is amazing! ,1
3800,36976,1.0,".  Please come back!!!! Yes your staff at points were complete morons, you are truely the best doctor there ever was! ",1
3801,36976,1.0, Dr. Nelson is the best.  He listens to concerns.  I had 4 of my children delivered by him.  I even came all the way from Arizona to have him deliver two of my babies.  My last baby I drove an hour and a half to have him deliver.  Great Dr. ,1
3802,36976,1.0," This was the worst doctor ever!! avoid him, he induced me at 37 weeks because he was &quot; sick&quot; of me, he yelled at me twice in his office, because he induced me so early, I was pregnant with my sixth child and ended up having an emergency c  section, i had never had a c section before, their was no need to induce me three weeks early, my baby has since had problems with speech etc.. AVOID this man, he is now in west valley city.  ",-1
3803,36979,1.0," I'm surprised there are not any reviews on here yet, as Dr. Nance is BY FAR the best dentist I have ever gone to! His office staff are absolutely wonderful, and have always taken the time to help me understand insurance and billing issues. Dr. Nance is kind and gentle, and answers all of my questions. Scheduling is always a breeze.  When I had a tooth break, he was able to get me in right away with no problem! I recommend him to anyone looking for a seriously great dentist! ",1
3804,36981,1.0, Awesome doctor - completely on his game and VERY punctual. Never have waited more than 10 minutes past appointment time.  ,1
3805,36989,1.0, IN August 2009 I fractured and spiraled my tibia and fibula while hiking Cedar Breaks.  Dr. Nakken's surgery fixed me AND the way in which he closed the incision left me with barely a fine line up my tibia. One can barely see it.   He is an excellent Orthopaedic surgeon! His work was seen by my San Diego Orthopaedic follow-up surgeon who also voiced the same opinion on Dr Nakken's work! ,1
3806,36989,1.0, Poor bedside manners and only cares about getting paid then your well being. Would not recommend! ,-1
3807,36989,1.0," I had compression fx on my vertebraes and he briefly told me everything looks fine, however; he did not even read the radiologist report that came with the xray. I had a bulge called a &quot;gibbus&quot; in my spine and I asked him what it was, he replied, &quot;It is probably just normal and you just haven't noticed it&quot;. A prestigious and profound radiologist said I have a gibbus... and your telling me it is normal and I haven't noticed it! Not very knowledgable. I wonder if he even looked at the xray. I waited for 1.5 hours for my appointment one time and another time they rescheduled my appointment on me when I already drove the distance. ",-1
3808,36989,1.0," I have seen Dr. Naaken several times and  will need surgery at some point. He has always answered questions and listened to my concerns. He took care of my husband for years,mostly with epidural injections until his Rheumatoid arthritis necessitated a power chair and chronic pain management. My husband is a retired physician and I am a retired RN and we can be very picky about our care. I hate to see someone bad mouth a caring Doctor. After all, we the patient, are ultimately responsible for our life style choices and need to realize that all outcomes are not perfect.  ",1
3809,36989,1.0," Had my arm crushed in a machine at work. This Dr. was doing little to help me. I ask him why. He said that he had determined that there was nothing for him to do surgery on and so and this I quote &quot;I don't care what else is wrong&quot; with the arm. Yup, I changed doctors. ",-1
3810,36991,1.0," Dr Nance is wonderful. He delivered my twins and he was very concerning with my needs for a multiple birth. I went into pre-term labor, and he was right there to check on me everyday until I had our babies. The office staff is also very friendly. 3 years later we had a surprise baby and I went back to Dr Nance and his professional staff and I still go back every year for my annual pap smear. ",1
3811,36991,1.0, I honestly love Dr Nance and his staff.  They are so kind and knowledgeable and caring.  They would answer ALL questions with compassion and intelligence.  I would HIGHLY recommend Dr Nance.  I knew I was in such great hands the whole time during a very high risk pregnancy.  He never talked down to me.  I notice that a lot of women on here are complaining about having their feelings hurt.  Maybe your feelings are hurt because you are pregnant and have a heightened hormone level and you just like to blame the doctor instead of realizing that.  I remember calling one time to see if I could just drop by and have my appointment a couple days early because I was in the area and the receptionist was so wonderful and accommodating. ,1
3812,36991,1.0," I had heard wonderful things about Dr. Nance so I tried to get an appointment with him about a very stressful, emotional issue.  I called to get an appointment and the receptionist was beyond rude and hurtful!!!  She did not take the time to listen to why I needed an appointment and quickly got me off the phone.  I don't care how great Dr. Nance is, I WILL NOT go to an office that treats their patients that way!! ",-1
3813,36991,1.0," I really enjoyed Dr. Nance! His appt are short but he would take time to listen if I had any questions. If I forgot to ask him something and he was with another patient, I would talk to his staff and they would answer or go ask him for me (I dont know if a lot of people understand but Dr are sooo busy!) Staff is amazing! I walk in and they greet me by name! I delivered my first when I was 24 (Im 26 and on baby #2! :D) so I was really nervous and he understands that. He has been doing this sooo long that he knows the drill. I have read a few of the complaints that some of the other ladies have said and some of it was obviously a mistake (We lern form them) but others are just opinions (like mine!) . I was in labor from 7am and had the baby at 11:25pm. :( I was told by several nurses that I should have had a c-section but the baby and I were fine so he felt I didnt need one! If your thinking about Dr. Nance, I would give him a try.  I had a great delivery, so should you! ",1
3814,36991,1.0," Dr. Nance is a good doctor with amazing nurse/office staff. I love how efficient the office is run--I had two other young children, and needed a good doctor who was also prompt. Dr. Nance is kind and experienced. ",1
3815,36991,1.0, Dr. Nance is the BEST!! He is such a nice guy and a great Dr.  He does keep appointments short and to the point but never makes you feel rushed.  If you have questions he is happy to answer them. He has a way of making you feel extremely comfortable as well.  I never felt awkward during my pelvic exams or during delivery.  He was so encouraging during my delivery and he came to the hospital the next day to check on me and called several times after I went home.  If I ever had questions during my pregancy he would call and answer them directly. I would highly suggest Dr. Nance!!! ,1
3816,36991,1.0," After I had my first baby, my episiotomy wasn't healing right. I went back to the Dr. I was going to and she just stitched me up again, I did this 2 more times. Finally I went to Dr. Nance and first look he said  I was allergic to the sutures she was using. What doctor wouldn't know that&#63; And yes, I'm an idiot for believing my first doctor that it was me that was wrong. (My husband even said are you sure she's not allergic&#63;) Dr. Nance fixed me up right away and have stayed with him ever since. His office staff is by far the nicest I've met. He remembers about my family whenever I go to appointments. I disagree about the comment that he finds reasons for C-sections, 3 babies later, they've all been natural. And no forceps.  I'm just hoping I'm done having babies before he retires! Highly recommend! ",1
3817,36991,1.0, I have been going to Dr. Nance for over 20 years.  He even delivered two of my grandchildren.  I love that he will call a patient personally when it is necessary.  He rocks! ,1
3818,36991,1.0," Dr. Nance was great! He was very highly recommended to me by my sister-in-law and mother-in-law who had had several miscarriages and really appreciated Dr. Nance's caring, understanding attitude during those hard experiences. He and his staff are very friendly and understanding. He returns phone calls with questions you may have personally and always told me that ANYTIME I was worried, I could come in and hear the heartbeat. He was also willing to induce me if I wanted. He was very caring and sensitive. Visits are very prompt and quick - they get right down to business and don't waste anytime. I will admit though, that sometimes they felt like they went a little too fast and I wished he would have dicussed more things with me. But, even though he didn't volunteer a whole ton of new information for me, he always asked if I had any questions and was willing to answer them all. During delivery (vaginal) he was very caring and knowledgable.  He listened to my desires and did a great job!! ",1
3819,36991,1.0," He is the most kind and considerate doctor.  I have had 2 babies with him and he will be delivering my 3rd baby any time.  I have had many complications with my pregnancies and he has been very concerned about me.  With this baby I started bleeding at 22 weeks and he was very concerned about the baby and me.  I had placental abruction.  He put me on bed rest for 8 weeks and has check me every week since then to make sure I'm ok and mostly the baby. He called me from his home to check on me, the hospital and his office.  I feel he has delivered enough babies to know what is normal and what is cause for concern.  Everyone makes mistakes once in a while.  I also had toxemia with my other babies and he watch that very close.  His staff is very friendly.  I would not have anyone else take care of my babies life and mine but him.  ",1
3820,36991,1.0, Dr. Nance was wonderful! He cared about me and what I was feeling. He wanted to know my opinion on things and did not make me feel like an idiot. He saved mine and my first baby's life. I have had 3 children with him as my doctor and recommend him to everyone! More than someone else's opinion you need to go an interview the doctors yourself. If you don't feel right about someone find another doctor that does feel right. Trust your own instincts. I switched from another horrible Dr. to Dr. Nance during my first pregnancy at 37 weeks. Dr. Nance listened to me and saved my life. I should have switched a whole lot sooner! I will deliver with him again! ,1
3821,36991,1.0, If you want a doctor that could care less about you then go to this one. My blood pressure was high and he could have cared less...didn't ask to see me sooner than the normal 4 weeks and by the time I got there I was sent to the hospital to deliver prematurly...He didn't care about my pain level during birth even though the epidural wasn't working...I can't think of one thing he did RIGHT! ,-1
3822,36991,1.0, I love Dr. Nance.  He has delivered 3 of my kids and will deliver my next.  I found him very friendly and has always tried to make my experience the way I want it.  I very rarely have had to wait during office visits and he has always answered all my concerns.  His staff is awesome and very efficient.  I have had all my kids without C-section but he is more than willing to induce if you want but does not pressure you to.  All in all I found him and his staff very personable and would and have recommended him to others. ,1
3823,36991,1.0," My sweet baby boy was born almost 17 years ago.  To this day, I cannot think of a better delivery experience than Dr. Nance.  My mom worked in the Nursery at Payson Hospital and she thought Dr. Nance was the greatest, she was very pleased that I chose him to deliver my son.  My son had fetal distress during labor and I tell you, Dr. Nance drove from his office in Springville to Provo Hospital at warp speed to be there.  He was very patient and assuring throughout my pregnancy.  I love his staff, especially Marilynn because she is also very NON judgemental and easy to talk to.  I hope Dr. Nance is around to deliver my grandchildren and I know that my mom would feel the same way.  Most of the nurses that worked with my mom highly reccomended Dr. Nance and I would certainly do the same....as a matter of fact, I have recommended him to many of my friends.  A+ in my book. ",1
3824,36991,1.0, Dr. Nance is so kind and patient. He returns all phonecalls personally. His staff is absolutely wonderful! I appreciated that I was able to see him for each of my prenatal appointments and also had him deliver my baby. ,1
3825,36991,1.0, I loved Dr Nance and his staff I can't say enough good things about him. ,1
3826,36991,1.0," I would honestly stick clear of Dr. Nance. With my first baby I started bleeding at 26 weeks and when I called his office, he told me I was being a paranoid first time mother. When the bleeding started up again, I went into the hospital and was dilated to a 6. I was put in the hospital immediately and pumped full of drugs in order to stop labor. I laid in the hospital for 2 weeks before delivering at 29 weeks. During that time he only came to the hospital twice to check on me, and that was because of the insistance of the nurse on duty that called him. HAD he not been so laid back and checked me when I first started bleeding, they could have done a circlage and my baby would have stayed in longer. Why risk it with a doctor who is too laid back to worry about the concerns of his patient&#63; He is a great person, but doctor, NO! ",-1
3827,36991,1.0," Dr. Nance puts you right at ease. He is kind and cares about his patients. His office staff is friendly and warm. They remember you from visit to visit and year to year. His office has a train and a play area complete with slide for kids in the waiting room. Dr. Nance knows what he's doing and does what is best for mother and baby. He cares what his patients want and doesn't railroad over their desires. He answers questions and gives you as much time as you need during your visit. He returns calls as soon as he can if you call when he's in with a patient. Overall, a great doctor. ",1
3828,37001,1.0," At first, I went to see him. He knows whats wrong with my knee and I was relief that he was the man that able to fix my knee. I suffered for 6 yrs for the pain.  A few days later I had a MCL surgery. Yes, it helped!!!  But there were some issues in my knee. BEfore I could explain what was wrong, He immediately referred me to see a spine doctor.    So I went.....it was a minor issue in my back but not sure if it was from my knee&#63;  So I called to see if he could give me a different medicine for my shoulder. I suspect that I have a rotator cuff issues.  He again told me it has something to do with my back. I was like.. no. It s not MY back!! He doesnt really listen to his patient very well. I am disappointed. Am not planning to see him for the follow up. I m looking for a doctor who can listen to me and my problems. :( ",-1
3829,37001,1.0," Dr. Nelson is the very best for knee surgery. He is very kind and takes a personal interest in his patients. His skill and knowledge are unsurpassed. He spent plenty of time with us to help us understand the benefits and risks of surgery and did a terrific job with the surgery. He is very well respected by the staff at the hospital, which is reassuring. He's done two surgeries on me as well as some other procedures and I was very happy with his manner and care each time I've seen him. There really is no one better if you are having knee surgery. ",1
3830,37001,1.0, Dr.Nelson is the best Orthopedic Surgeon I ever meant.I was seen another Orthopedic before Dr. Nelson and he told me that he was going to do my knees when I turn 60 yrs old. Dr.Nelson and his staff have been very nice to my.They go out of there way to serve the people.And there always smiling.I'm glad I chose the right surgeon. ,1
3831,37001,1.0, There is no one better.  He has been awesome with me my husband and several members of our family. ,1
3832,37001,1.0," I waited over an hour past my appointment to see the doctor.  He spent literally less than one minute listening to my issue and before I could even finish describing the problem, he had diagnosed my problem and was sending me out the door.  I appreciate a doctor that first listens to the issue before making a diagnosis, thus Dr. Nelson was not a good match for me.  (My insurance company was not listed in the options drop down, but I have great insurance) ",-1
3833,37001,1.0, Dr. nelson is not only a great Dr. but a fantastic man his concerns a for his patience are sincere he makes you feel as though you are his only patient.  ,1
3834,37001,1.0, AWEOSOME DOC! ENERGETIC AND VERY KNOWLEDGABLE. HIS OFFICE HELP IS THE BEST. THEY ARE SO WILLING TO WORK WITH ANY SCHEDULE.  ,1
3835,37001,1.0," I had to come home from my mission to have knee surgery, and he did an incredible job. I had pain for about 2 or 3 days is all. I have been without pain, the surgery was great. I am walking almost as good as before within about 4 weeks of therapy. Very impressed with the dr. ",1
3836,37001,1.0, He has operated on both my elbows about 10-12 years ago and I have not had any problems since. This was after several years of severe pain. ,1
3837,37001,1.0, He has done surgery on 5 of the 6 members of my family over the last nine years and we love Dr. Nelson. He is very knowledgeable in his field and really cares about his patients.  ,1
3838,37002,1.0, I no longer go to this dentist. But i went to him for my whole childhood dentist needs including my braces i loved his staff and how friendly he was i would recommend him to everyone you will how you are treated and will want you kids to go back to him and his wonderful staff!!! ,1
3839,37002,1.0," He pulled my sons teeth out before he was completly numb, he put sealants over cavities, He ignored cavities. When we switched dentists with our children we had a bill of over $4500.00 dollars.  Because there was so much catch up work to be done. ",-1
3840,37005,1.0, He was very nice. ,1
3841,37008,1.0," My husband and I have been seeing DR Nelson for over a year. Pros- he sees patients on Monday evenings and we never have to wait, very to the point. Cons- after 1.5 years we feel our medical concerns have not improved, constantly adjusting meds and making us go back every 30 days, more copays, more ineffective meds.  If you are looking for a doctor to see once in a while when you have strep or something, DR Nelson would be fine, but it you are looking for solutions for ongoing medical issues, you may want to go elsewhere.  ",-1
3842,37008,1.0," He has a terrible staff that assist to everything bit the patient. He has very little knowledge of meds prescribed or dosages that he should prescribe. Went through three different meds within days and doesn't have a problem prescribing a larger dose of the medication that works... Oh but first another appo intment is required and 170.00 charge incured even after appointments to specialists he referred me to are made. Horrible experience and being polite isn't what makes a doctor, experience and knowledge on the other hand would be a great trait, if all your worried about is someone being polite...  See a pastor! Horrible experience more then once over! ",-1
3843,37008,1.0, His Staff is very friendly and helpful! He is very kind and helpful as well. He actually listens to what is being said and takes care of the problem. I would recommend this doctor to anyone!!! ,1
3844,37008,1.0, Love this doctor.  He's extremely helpful and friendly. Going to the doctor isn't a bad experience.  ,1
3845,37008,1.0," I knew more about the medicines he was prescribing than he, including that Vioxx had been taken off the market, that Ketek was no longer recommended for sinus infections, etc. I am allergic to penicillin and get frequent sinus infections, so finding a good medicine is difficult. Really nice, caring doctor, though. ",1
3846,37008,1.0, Left too many decisions up to &quot;mothers intuition&quot;. I go to a doctor for their expertise otherwise I would confer with myself. I really didn't have 100% confidence which is why I left. He was unquestionably a nice man though. ,1
3847,37008,1.0," Dr. Nelson is by far the best internal medicine and pediatrician I have ever been to. My children and I have been seeing him for nearly 10 years now, and wouldn't consider seeing anybody else. He's kind, funny, patient, and knows when to refer a patient to another specialist (not afraid to say &quot;I don't know&quot; when he really doesn't know). His nurses and staff are also friendly, quick and knowledgeable. I would and have recommended Dr. Nelson without reservation.  ",1
3848,37011,1.0, I have never experienced a doctor that has not listened to his patient. His ego and lack of empathy is beyond blinds him to his patients needs. ,-1
3849,37011,1.0, One of the most friendly doctors I have ever met.  Will and have recommended him to many people.  The best bedside manner I have ever seen and I am a nurse so I have seen a lot of doctors.  ,1
3850,37017,1.0, I have been going to Dr. Quinn for 13 years and I adore him.  He is the best doctor. He has taken care of me through all 3 pregnancies. He is always willing to listen and answer questions.  He gets behind because of it but I don't mind at all! I am extremely comfortable with him.  Vickie is also amazing! ,1
3851,37017,1.0, Dr. Quinn was amazing he is absolutley the best.  He provided all the information and answered all my questions. If your a first timer to having a child he is the man to see.  ,1

3862,37026,1.0, I would not go to anyone else for cosmetic surgery. Dr. Ralston is very professional and knowledgeable when it comes to his specialty. He removed a sun scar from my temple and there is no trace of it ever being there and no scar. He has a warm and friendly bedside manner and made me feel comfortable the entire time. He has a great reputation in this area and it is well deserved.  I was a bit worried when looking for a surgeon and he was recommended to me by a close friend. I was very happy with my choice.  The staff was friendly from the moment I walked in the door and remained so even when things became busy. If you are looking for cosmetic surgery give his office a call. ,1
3863,37026,1.0, Ralston did my breast augmentation and they turned out lopsided. He would not fix them without my having to pay again. I am stuck with lopsided boobs. Paid/Co-pay:$3500,-1

3866,37026,1.0," Very pleased with my results. I Had breast augmentation in 2005 and Lipo the 1st of Oct. I live in another state and I never had a post op appointment, I never felt like I needed one. If I had and questions, all I had to do was call, or send them a picture/email and they would respond as soon as they could. I love my results and would recommend him to everyone! ",1
3867,37026,1.0," I have had 4 different surgeries over the last 8 years from Dr. Ralston and I am very pleased with the results. He is not only knowelgeable, but has a wonderful bedside manner of making you feel very comfortable. ",1
3868,37026,1.0,  Paid/Co-pay:$3500,-1
3869,37030,1.0, Doctor was NOT patient advocate. I felt that he did not believe me. I felt like it was him vs. me. He was not helpful.  ,-1
3870,37033,1.0, He listened and worked with me to find the proper diagnosis. He is tapering off anxiety meds and soon I think I can me med free ,1
3871,37041,1.0," The front office staff was slow, and didn't seem to know what they were doing. The dr. Came in with a frown and acted bothered we were there, then turned me and my autistic son away unwilling to help treat him. I am very unsatisfied and shocked a pediatric doctor would act this way! ",-1
3872,37043,0.0, I took my 18 year old daughter in to have her wisdom teeth taken out and I was very impressed with the Dr.. She calmed her fears of the procedure. Everything went smooth. I recommend South Ogden Dental to all my family and friends. ,1
3873,37046,1.0," Above the curve in care.  Dr. Raemisch did a procedure in a new way on my CMC joint that saved me months of healing and therapy.  Two other doctors would have put me in a cast for 12 weeks with 12 weeks of therapy.  I was working pretty normally in 6 weeks. He has treated my tendonitis in office and I am back up to speed quickly again.  I am very pleased with how up to date on medical practices and best practices for his patients that Dr. Raemisch is.  He is very kind and compassionate and so smart.  My hands are problems, so I will be back to see him when they act up.  He's a great doctor. ",1

3876,37056,1.0, Best Doctor in Blanding. He was extremely helpful and cared greatly for the people of Blanding and the surrounding town. He will be greatly missed. ,1
3877,37056,1.0, No followup on testing could never get results.  ,-1
3878,37057,1.0, Dr. Raymond’s arrogance and lack of professionalism resulted in our son not getting the advanced care he needed and going blind.  If a law suit would bring back sight we would have sued him. Sense that time not even a question of “how is he doing” has been offered. ,-1
3879,37057,1.0,.  Very good surgeon and eye specialist ,1
3880,37061,1.0," I love Dr. Rappleye, he and his staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, I have always felt comfortable and welcome.  He also has a very quirky sense of humor, that I enjoy and this being my first pregnancy I really appreciate that.  I would definitely recommend him to others.   I would agree that sometimes it takes a while to see him but I take it as a good sign that so many others love him too! ",1
3881,37061,1.0," In 2001 I told Dr. Rappleye I wanted my prolapsed uterus pulled up.  He recommended a hysterectomy instead.  I  also had a fibroid tumor in my uterus but later found out it could’ve been removed through laser surgery.  After recovering, sex did not feel near as good and still does not.  I joined hystersisters.com and talk with women that say this is why they had a supracervical laparoscopic surgery where you get to keep your cervix.  Sex without the cervix is not as good.  I then ask Dr. Rappleye why my cervix was removed and he said, “Marcia, all doctors in the U.S. remove the cervix with the uterus.”   Oh really Doctor!!! I go to  the yellow pages for a new doctor and there was a doctor advertising right there in a yellow page ad that he does the supracervical hysterectomy –it said “preserve your cervix.”  3 yrs ago I had to have my bladder put in a sling.  This is what you get when trusting your doctor instead of doing your research.     Marcia ",-1
3882,37061,1.0," Dr.Rappleye is a wonderful doctor. One of my derest friend recommended him when my insurance no longer worked for my previous OBGYN, Dr.Katheryn Walker who is also a great doctor. He's very friendly and he recently delivered my baby. He was great at the hospital and I had a great time delivering my baby boy. I do appreciate my frined's referal and I'd strongly recomend him as well. His nurse, Holly is also very thorough and nice.  ",1
3883,37061,1.0," Doctor Rappleye was VERY helpful... We loved him. The entire experience was really streamlined and facilitated by his knowledge and bedside manner. He delivered my wife, and now has delivered our first child. I intend to go back to him for all of our children if he is still practicing. He is not always punctual, but he has alot of very loyal patients, and come on, its pregnancy...  they can deliver anytime, how do you plan a day around that&#63;! ",1
3884,37061,1.0, Dr. Rappleye has delivered three of our four sons.  He was leaps and bounds better than our first OB and has a very funny (tactful) sense of humor.  He just delivered our twins four weeks ago and did a fantastic job in doing so.  We were going to switch insurance and he was not going to be in our network and my wife would have none of it even though we don't know if we are going to have any more children.  We would recommend him to everyone.  My aunt is a charge nurse at the new IMC (labor and delivery) and says that he is really good.  He takes the time to explain anything and hasn't been in too much of a hurry for us.  We know several other families that used him before we switched and everyone of them had nothing but good to say about him.  ,1
3885,37061,1.0, Dr. Rappleye was great!  He made me feel very comfortable and always took the time to talk to me and made sure that all of my questions were answered.  I would highly recommend him to anyone! ,1

3889,37061,1.0, Excellent bedside manner. Extremely competent. Comfortable and fast exam. ,1
3890,37061,1.0," At first he was good, then he decided one pregnancy for me was enough. He wouldn't discuss it any further. I was very disapointed in him. ",-1
3891,37061,1.0, He was very good at what he did when he wanted to be. He made you feel very comfortable. I went to him throughout my whole preganancy and I guess I just expected him to review my whole file before my appointment so I didn't have to remind him about what was going on. Other than that all the questions I asked he gave an answer for. Paid/Co-pay:$700,1
3892,37065,0.0," Nicole is the best medical professional I've associated with.  I had been to several other dermatologists and none seemed to really care all that much about my problem.  They would just do whatever was standard procedure and send me on my way.  Nicole actually cared about me and would go the extra mile to make sure I received the treatment I needed.  I highly recommend her, she is very thorough.  ",1
3893,37071,2.0," I was pleased with the visit, and the doctor.  The nurses and desk people seemed nice too.  ",1
3894,37075,1.0, Our family doctor referred us to Dr. Ralston when we noticed autistic-like developmental delays in our son. He recommended that we get him into our school districts early intervention program since he didn't really fit the bill for &quot;autistic&quot;. He also gave us other suggestions which we implemented. We noticed changes immediately.  ,1
3895,37075,1.0, Dr. Ralston and his staff are wonderful. Dr. Ralston is an experience Peds Physician who cares about the children that come into his care.

3899,37092,0.0," She was very unprofessional, condescending, and rude. She did not want to partner in my child's care and was not open to even hearing what/how our baby was doing.  Instead she used fear tactics and threats to scare us into doing it her way and to shut us (the parents) up.  She was dismissive, did not ever have time for questions.  She was very inconsistent and would change what she had told us to do from appointment to appointment. I had pre-interiewed her prior to the arrival of my child and received friend recommendations.  I would NOT under any circumstance recommend her.  She is very dangerous considering the fact she is working with newborns and post delivery moms. ",-1

She is warm and friendly and my daughter loves her.  I highly recommend her! ,1
3902,37092,0.0," She's been our Doctor for the last 3 years. This Doctor is quick to write a prescription rather then looking at the entire picture and/or medical history. I wouldn't recommend his doctor; in fact, we're looking for somebody else. ",-1

He doesn't try to rush through our well checkups.  He always takes the time to talk to my daughter and to answer questions or inform me of different things.

You can't hardly tell anything was done even if you look close. All of my family sees Dr. Rasmussen and their families.  ",1
3915,37115,1.0, Too bad he's not avaialbe anymore.  I was very happy with his approach and interest in finding solutions that would work.  ,1
3916,37115,1.0," I like Dr. Rada.  He actually fully listens and tries his best to help his patients. He is respectful, never condescending. His office staff also has always been nice - I don't understand any negative comments about them.  I like that Dr. Rada is willing to try new things to help his patients.  My only complaint about him is that he just seemed to have given up on finding the answer to my problem after a number of referrals and tests did not yield an answer.  My message to Dr.  Rada:  Don't give up on a patient and don't consider a patient to be a hypochondriac just because specialists and tests have not arrived at a diagnosis!! Symptoms are real!! Keep trying!! ",1
3917,37115,1.0, Dr Rada will explain things to me in a way that I can understand.  He will give me his professional opinion and when I ask his personal opinion.  He makes sure that I understand what my options are then lets me make my own choice.  He is open to alternative options in medicine.  I would readily recommend him to all. ,1
3918,37115,1.0, HE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL DOCTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN HE KNOWS HIS STUFF. HE TAKES TIME WITH YOU. HIS FRONT OFFICE STAFF IS AWFUL THEY ARE SO RUDE AND DONT CARE ABOUT ANYONE THEY SUCK ,1
3919,37115,1.0," My insurance, PEHP, is not listed as an option.  Dr. Rada is the best.  I'm twice his age; may he by my M.D. until I expiere! ",1
3920,37115,1.0," THIS MAN IS UNBELIEVABLE, HE IS A FRIEND, AND TREATS ME WITH RESPECT.  I STARTED WITH HIM WHEN A DR TALKED DOWN TO ME, AND MADE ME FEEL TERRIBLE.  I HAVE MULTIPLE HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND HIS KNOWLEDGE IS FANTASTIC.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WAITING TIME HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE TIME HE SPENT WITH THE PACIANT., AND THE ONES HE SEES BECAUSE OF EMERGENCIES.  I HAVE HAD QUITE A FEW DRS, BUT NONE MORE CARING AND GREAT IN EVERY WAY.  THE REASON HE IS SO BUSY IS THAT HIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN EXPANDED BY WORD OF MOUTH AS TO HOW GOOD HE IS.  I TRULY APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT HE IS CONCERNED ANS GOES THE EXTRA MILE.  ",1
3921,37115,1.0," If you can ignore the indifferent staff and get to Dr Rada, he is outstanding.  He is caring and treats you as a person and not just a patient.  He is one of the best I have ever been to.  ",1
3922,37115,1.0, Dr. Rada was wonderful to visit with and very personable...once you got to him. I've never waited for less than an hour and the office seems to be somewhat chaotic.  ,1
3923,37115,1.0," Dr. Rada is very good. He is knowledgable, considerate, takes the time to listen, and explains things so they are understood. His front office staff is a joke! They are rude, self-absorbed, slow, disrespectful, and could care less if you are waiting. We waited 30 minutes for a blood draw--saw people walk in from the outside go before us before I finally asked the person at the desk (after having to interrupt her from her personal chit-chat with another employee) why we were still waiting, to which she said, &quot;oops, just a minute,&quot; then blamed the technician, saying, &quot;she is a fill-in and doesn't know the procedure.&quot; Come to find out, the person at the desk had put my file face down on the counter instead of in the slot with the other files, and the tech hadn't seen it there. Go for the good doctor, but be prepared to have to fight the front office staff to get back to see him! Paid/Co-pay:$25",1
3924,37115,1.0," After taking my son and college athlete to see two specialists for severe back pain, I took him to see Mark Rada. He spent over an hour with us, diagnosed the problem (a broken piece of bone pushing on the spinal cord), and recommended surgical treatment by a nurosurgeon. Dr. Rada turned my son's health and life around. Great doctor. ",1
3925,37115,1.0," Dr Rada listens to his patients as good as any doctor now days. He is more open to homoepathic ideas than the norm and is happy to work with a patient who wants to include supplimentation in their life. Good diabetes MD. Not afraid of medicine, but not a pill happy MD either. Great balance, I am very happy with him and I am quite the picky dude. ",1

3930,37117,0.0,"Dr. Updike is busy and runs behind on all of her appts, but the time she does spend is the best quality time any Dr. has ever spent with me.  She educates the patient, but not in a condescending way.  She is very helpful and is attentive to even the smallest problems.  She has a great reputation with everyone who I talk to.  I would agree with them.  Her staff could be better with making appts. and answering their phones, but the Dr. herself is without fault.  I give her an outstanding recommendation to anyone especially with auto immune disorders.  ",1

3934,37120,0.0,Great doctor with good bedside manner.  Staff was very nice and helpful.   Would highly recommend them! ,1
3935,37120,0.0,My prescription was way off.  After my doctor eye exam I got my glasses at a  different clinic because as I felt the staff was only interested in selling me frames. When I got the glasses I could not even read the top line of the eye chart with the new glasses. I had them checked by another doctor and the glasses were per the prescription but the prescription was wrong.  A friend had warned me that she had the same experience and couldn't use her glasses at all. I think they have too many lay people doing the examining and the wait in between each part of the exam was very long.  The appointment lasted over 11/2 hours and  most of the time I was sitting alone in a tiny room. ,-1
3936,37121,1.0,Outstanding MD. Great concern and compassion for his patients. ,1
3937,37121,1.0,"Well he has been my doctor for 20 years, and my family's for over 20 years. He's amazing because he listens and gives you time to express your concerns. Whenever I was sick or had a problem even if he was booked that day he would always fit me in. Plus if something was wrong it was immediately dealt with. Such as treatment or sending me to the hospital for tests. but I was always treated with respect and dignity. Also if he isn't completely sure of what you have he will send you to someone who can help you. Usually a specialist. He's a great man and I hope he keeps up the good work and remains successful. ",1
3938,37121,1.0,"Doc dismissed my concerns and wanted to solve all my problems with pills. Preachy, lack of compassion. I feel he made un-fare assumptions about my sudden weight gain and my alcohol consumption. I will be moving on for a second opinion as well as an alternative doctor.  ",-1
3939,37121,1.0,"Dr. Udall has been my Doc for 15 years. He and his staff are so helpful. He has never made me feel rushed, and always answered my questions in a caring manner.  Wait times seem to be up slightly since the move to the new clinic, but he managed to bring most of the great staff with him.  I would highly recommend him to anyone. ",1
3940,37121,1.0,Dr King Udall is 1 in a million. With a bedside manner that shows his dedication when it comes to identifying and treating your condition. And unlike many other doctors he wont make you feel rushed or hurried. He is what a doctor should be.  :) ,1

3942,37123,1.0,"I have been to 6-7 chiropractors within couple of years seeking help for my chronic problem.  I have researched on the website and found about his practice. I am very satisfied and recommend him highly.  Very knowledgeable, caring, professional and takes his time to explain problems and show exercises to strengthen.  Definitely different from those chiropractors that wants you keep coming.  You'll be glad you did go see him.  He's also the official Utah Grizzlies chiropractor! ",1

3944,37123,1.0,Dr. Ulibarri Was awesome. He listened to me carefully and not only was able to help but offered practices that will keep me healthy. He was professional. I referred my Mom who was having so much pain she was staying home rather than going out to join her friends. Dr. Ulibarri  was able to help her get back on her feet. The decrease in her pain has given her more energy to do what she enjoys. ,1

3946,37124,1.0,"I've had some minor bleeding gums issues for the last while and have seen 2 other dentists. Dr. Updyke was the only one who gave me the right stuff to treat it. Great experience, great staff. Only sold me what I absolutely needed and let me decide if I wanted anything additional. Best dentist I've ever gone to. ",1
3947,37124,1.0,"I am almost 50, have good teeth.  He stops to see me even if I'm only in for a cleaning (something that was not true of other dentists I've seen).  He has done a few fillings for me but never tried to get me to accept any services that seemed unnecessary (like teeth whitening, for example).  Staff is friendly.  I am always seen punctually and I agree with the other reviewer who noted that he does not overbook his time.  I trust that his knowledge is good to excellent but I'm not sure how a patient could accurately evaluate that.  ",1
3948,37124,1.0,Great dentist! He is always keeping up on his knowledge and how he can better serve his patients. I would recommend him to anyone. ,1
3949,37124,1.0,Scott Updyke is a wonderful dentist and person. He's compassionate and kind. I have a had a long time phobea of dentists and Dr. Updyke and his staff went out of their way to make me more comfortable. Dr. Updyke also helps his patients make informed decisions regarding their treatment and care. He and his staff are a wonderful team and my family will remain patients of his for years to come! ,1
3950,37124,1.0,started out small but with all the crowns he sold people he now has a big staff and of course wears gold chains...bought and paid for by all the crown sales.  phoeey ,-1
3951,37124,1.0,"I'm a doctor and have taken a critical eye toward finding the best dentist. His technical competence is extremely high, his judgment is excellent, and he will not sell you treatments you do not need, which is a problem with most dentists, who want to generate income. He medical knowledge is very current, and he uses the best technologies in-house very competently. He does not overbook his time, so you get his complete attention. His staff is tops. You will not find a better dentist in Utah. ",1
3952,37124,1.0,Dr. Updyke is a fantastic dentist. His office is clean and organized. The wait is usually very short. He is very good about emergency (right now) appointments. He seems to have a very high turnover among his staff and a billing clerk that makes me want to snatch myself bald. She's very frustrating to work with. ,1
3953,37125,1.0,"I had been diagnosed with FM, in extreme pain daily but I kept working because I have a strong work ethic. I've never been arrested or been addicted to any drug at all;however, this doctor made me feel like a criminal. He interrogated me as if I had been accused of a crime. I was extremely insulted by his methodology and &quot;bed side manner&quot;. If you are a regular person who only wants answers, don't go here because you'll pay for an unnecessary drug test by a narcisstic doctor that only cares about his ego and pocket-book. ",-1
3954,37126,1.0,"He did an an excellent job on a full face lift.  I would totally recommend Dr Urban in every way. I am 63 years old and I look like I am 50 years old. My neck and skin are smooth and without wrinkles. The wrinkles around my eyes are also gone.  My older daughters don't know I had anything done.  They say I look so good but they can't tell I had the face lift.  One daughter asked if I was using a new face cream. I want to say thank-you, thank-you, thank-you Dr Urban . ",1
3955,37128,1.0,"Dito to all that has been said.  He takes the time he needs to really understand you  treats you like you are in his own personal practice, not just another student patient. ",1
3956,37128,1.0,"Amazing doctor. I have never been very impressed with doctors at the health center, but Dr. Willmore is an exception. I was very apprehensive about my first gynecology visit, but he put me at easy and was very kind. He answered all my questions, regarding several different topics including getting pregnant, some issues i'd been having with my stomach, and did a full physical. He was very kind and made the appointment as un-awkward as he possibly could. ",1
3957,37128,1.0,He is the best in the BYU students Health Center. He will always answer all the questions and he is very nice ,1
3958,37128,1.0,"Because of this guy, no other doctor seems good enough. I cannot describe it how great Dr. Willmore is. He listented, cared, never left anything to guessing, always went the extra mile to make sure every doubt was removed. He is also very very kind and polite.

3959,37128,1.0,"My husband and I LOVE Dr. Willmore.  Best Doctor I've ever had.  He is thorough in answering questions and makes you feel like the most important person.  He treated our infertility, and was very optimistic. I wish he could be my doctor through the pregnancy. ",1
3960,37128,1.0,"Dr. Willmore is wonderful. He takes the time to listen, and isn't afraid to say that he doesn't know the answer. Not only that, but for the questions he can't answer, he either looks up the necessary information or makes a direct referral to someone else who might know. He was very knowledgeable, and I appreciated his kindness and his sincerity. ",1

He always seems genuinely interested in helping you and is willing to spend as much time with you as necessary. He will answer as many questions as you'd like and never makes you feel like you need to hurry up. What really impressed me was that I had gone in for a routine check up for my IUD. While there he decided to do a physical with me just to make sure everything else was working. I was so impressed b/c he went above and beyond to check these extra things that I didn't even ask him to. It saved me an extra doctor's visit. I would highly recommend Dr. Willmore! ,1

I always felt comfortable with him and felt that I could ask him anything. When I was in labor, I was the only one of his patients at the hospital. He came in to check on me every 2 hours and made sure he was there if I needed anything. I ended up needing a c-section, but he let me try to deliver vaginally for as long as I wanted, until it was dangerous for my son. He was very joking and made the mood light during the c-section. He made me feel like I had control of what went on during labor, and it made things not so scary for me. I liked that he wasn't such a serious, stone cold doctor. I am really sad that he isn't at his practice anymore. ",1

He's accessible and I feel I can relate to him. He's friendly but also professional. He delivered my third child and I was very happy with the way everything turned out.

He always answers any questions you have very nicely, no matter how stupid you think the question is.  You never have a long wait at his office, and his nurse Sam is awesome and very helpful as well.  I have never once left there feeling like my time with him was rushed or that he was too busy to take care of any and all the needs you have, and always has a good answer to any question I have ever asked him.

Every time I go in for a well child visit he askes me lots of questions about my sons development and askes for my questions. When I do have any he answeres them without seeming rushed or impatient. He is very gental with my son when he does the physical check up, i.e. looking in his ears.

I have been very impressed with his willingness to continue to learn and he is not afraid to admit when he isn't sure about something.  The bad thing, is that his staff is not so educated about the disease and could have severely hurt me, if I wasn't so knowledgeable about my disease and knew they were making mistakes.  I have recommended my family to go to him. ",1
4005,37143,2.0,Very helpful. Worked price out with my insurance. Thanks dr.  Winkel ,1
4006,37144,1.0,Dr. Willis delivered 2 of my 3 babies and did a excellent job.  My boys just love him.  He is the nicest most caring doctor I have ever had. He has been doing this for years now and knows exactly what to do without pulling out a book like other doctors I have had.  He calls his patients personally and listens to you until your done talking even though he is very busy.  If you want a doctor who actually cares about you and your well being than Dr. Willis is the Doctor for you.  My family and I will be going to him until he retires.  ,1
4007,37144,1.0,"Very lazy! He just prescribes a medicine and hopes it goes away. He declined to help a friend who was critically ill who could not get out of her car. He was careless and almost let my brother get very sick due to severe jaundas that he somehow missed. He said he &quot;was strong&quot;, but my brother needed the Billy lights. Careless, uncordial, rude, unknowledgable. ",-1
4008,37144,1.0,I've been going to him since about 7th grade. He has delivered two out of my three babies. And the one he did not was because i lived to far away from him like 5 hrs. He listens to you and what you want and what you think might be wrong with your body. He is very good about getting back to you on tests and other things he calls you personally. He is one of a kind and even though i live at least a half hr away now i still go into him. Dr Willis is one of a kind and will be hard to replace once he retires. ,1
4009,37144,1.0,"Compassionate, professional, yet warm and personal, they don't make them like Dr. Willis anymore. ",1

4012,37147,1.0,Dr. Welling saved our son Kyle after a severe head trauma.  We owe our sons life to him and his willingness to go beyond the norm.  ,1
4013,37147,1.0,"In great pain when I showed up to his office on a Monday morning, within 72 I had had surgery and was, for the most part, out of pain. While curt, Dr. Welling was prompt, compassionate, knowledgeable, and instructive. It has been over a year since that fateful week, and not a day goes by that I'm not grateful for all that Dr. Welling did for me. (And while I have a scar on my neck as a memento, he did such a superb surgical job, that not one person has noticed the scar. When I have mentioned the surgery, I actually have to point out the scar. Truly amazing!) ",1
4014,37148,1.0,"Dr. Willden is a very quick dentist, too quick.  He doesn't take the time to do an in mouth exam, just looks at the xrays.  The two times he has done fillings for my family, one had to be replaced and the other one ended up having to have a root canal and crown because he exposed the pulp of the tooth by digging too deep. (I had another dentist fix this problem)  I have not been impressed by Dr. Willden and do not trust his judgement nor his dental skills.  I will not go back to him again. ",-1
4015,37148,1.0,"After 18 months my 2 front crowns that he said needed to be replaced now have a gap and is caused by wrong bite as the lower teeth hit against the back of the 2 front teeth. Others he replaced in front have black showing through caused from bacteria as the teeth were not seated correctly or the crown was not sterile when seated. When I requested for the work to be done over I was told I would have to pay for lab charges. I filed a complaint with insurance and then was told he would not see me anymore. Beware also of their book work. Keep track of all charges and payments. They do not have the knowledge nor ability to apply payments to each tooth worked on. They just keep a running total of charges and payments. Nothing matches and they cannot reconcile your account. This information is honest and I am not being malicious, just trying to save someone else from the grief and cost I am going through getting my teeth fixed and back to normal.  ",-1
4016,37148,1.0,watch your statements they like to do hidden charges.  ,1
4017,37149,1.0,"Dr. Ward it the best OB I've ever had!  He is very reassuring and he seems more “laid back”—which I really like.  He will answer any of your questions, and he if very calm and comfortable.  I love how fast and efficient he is.  He is very willing to work with you on different kinds of deliveries and is open to your opinions.  However, he will always put mom and baby’s health first—which is great!  We didn’t know that my baby had health problems before she was born, but when the delivery started to get hard, he was only concerned about getting her here safely.  I LOVE Dr.  Ward!! ",1
4018,37149,1.0,"I think Dr. Ward is a very knowledgable and caring doctor. He is excellent and professional in his care and always takes time to answer as many questions as you can come up with, regardless of the question. He is quick to reassure the mother of the health of the baby and understands that a mother's concerns are most important. He will order extra tests to figure out what is going on or for mere reassurance. He is quick and efficient should a complication arise. Dr. Ward is also excellent and fast with IUDs so it isn't too painful. He is a very skilled physician and I would recommend him to anyone. He also has a great ability to remember his patients and what is going on in their lives.  ",1
4019,37149,1.0,Dr. Ward has helped me through 5 pregnancies! He has delivered 2 of my babies and I miscarried the other two and I am pregnant again! With the miscarriages he performed the d&c; and was so kind and understanding. My husband and I moved 40 miles away and I still insist on seeing him because he is that great of a doctor. He never makes you feel stupid when you ask questions and he is very knowledgable of your history with him.  ,1
4020,37149,1.0,"a great guy, good sense of humor, and gets right to the problem to get it resolved as quickly as possible.  ",1
4021,37149,1.0,"I had to go to Dr. ward because it was the only doctor in the area that my insurance covered, so i was terrified at first to go to a male OB, but i LOVE doctor ward.  He's got a great balance between professionalism and being personable, and I never feel judged or guilty for asking too many questions or for having any concerns.  I'm having some complications right now with preclampsia and he's staying right on top of it, which i appreciate.  I also fell and hit my head in my 2nd trimester and he didn't just brush it off, he took it seriously and took all the precautionary measures and tests that i wanted in order to not be worried anymore.  I haven't had him deliver a baby of mine yet, but I'm pretty confidant that I'll have a positive experience with him.  Any problems I have aren't with him but his staff-Their receptionist gave me some wrong information about the childbirth classes so I'm barely getting the classes in by the time my baby's born. ",1
4022,37149,1.0,We where having problems having a child and he put us on clomed.  When I started having bad side effects I called him to ask him what I should do&#63;  He got very defensive and said &quot;I am just trying to help you get pregnant.&quot; Then I asked what should I do keep taking it or stop&#63;  He said it you want to get pregnant you have to keep taking it!   Next. I had 1 miscarriage and he was nice and sympathetic I came in the next month and he asked have you been able to get pregnant yet&#63; He must not have annoteted in his chart I guess.  2 months later I got pregnant again and they confirmed the pregnancy.  Again I lost the child and the following week he asked again if I had ever been able to get pregnant.  Either he doesn't know how to read or doesn't write it down. He was rude and abrupt.  By the way after the 3 miscarriage and round of questioning I changed dr's. ,-1
4023,37149,1.0,This OB is the BEST! He has delievered 2 out of 3 of my children. He is very helpful and knowledgeable. He understands my needs. When ever I have a question or anything he calls back right away or comes right to the phone. The staff is amazing! They are alway very friendly and treat you like a best friend. Will go back annually and with next baby...  ,1

I am now having my 3rd and I would not want to have anyone else, but him delivering my babies. I feel that he knows who I am and knows my special circumstances. He was much better than my first dr. I look forward each month to see him. I never wait in the waiting room for more than just a couple of mins.  ",1
4027,37149,1.0,Dr. Ward is a very nice man he makes me feel very comfortable I love his staff they are very nice the only thing I do not like is it seems that ward doesnt do all he should in knowing how your pregnancy is going he seems lazy and does not do all the checkup tests when I go to see him its more like a hi good to see u visit then a informational one.  I wait a while to see him then when I do its only for like 2 minutes ,1
4028,37149,1.0,"Although he is quite nice; he is known to give very, very bad advice such as sitting in hot tubs for 20 minutes for back pain (big no, no in pregnancy), taking medications that you shouldn't take while pregnant, etc.  He also never thoroughly checks you when you have a problem, his response is always, &quot;you're pregnant, it's normal&quot;.  Tell that to me the next day when I'm in the hospital and they are telling me that I have this infection and that infection, and I was going into pre-term labor, etc.  I would really recommend almost ANY doctor over Dr. Ward and am in the process of switching doctors right now at 28 weeks pregnant. ",-1
4029,37149,1.0,Everytime I have seen Dr. Ward I never spend more than a couple of minutes in the waiting room.

4030,37150,2.0,"Easy to find.  Right in the strip mall.  Super nice website, very helpful.  Dr did an exam to find out what was wrong and took care of my headaches.  I'm going back in for sure.  I'll be bringing my family and friends too. ",1
4031,37151,0.0,Dr. Williams performed surgery on one of my daughters.  A couple of years later my other daughter needed surgery.  He was fantanstic.  She needs her other foot done and we are heading back in to see him.  Dr. Williams makes you feel like you've known him for years. ,1
4032,37151,0.0,Dr. Williams is very knowledgable.  I went to him after another podiatrist made a mistake on my feet.  He fixed the problem without more surgery.  One of the most knowledgeable foot and ankle people I've every seen. ,1
4033,37152,0.0,"In a rush. Seemed stressed and pressed. Couldn't diagnose the problem, so she told me there wasn't a problem. The problem has recurred twice since I saw her. ",-1
4034,37153,1.0,"My appointment with Winmill was one of the most thorough and thoughtful clinic visits I'd had in a long time - maybe ever. I was treated with complete respect and genuine interest in what my issues were. He wasted no time poring through the data to figure out and treat the disease as soon as possible. He has absolutely found his niche with endocriniology. I don't know why practitioners like this are so hard to find in a clinical setting, but we'd all be lucky to have doctors/NP's like David Winmill at every visit.  ",1
4035,37153,1.0,"I have had type 1 diabetes for 21 years. David has helped me more than he will ever know.  He helped and encouraged me to get my A1C down and had hope in me.  I have 2 healthy children and all it took was someone believing in me.  He is a great, generous, and caring man. ",1
4036,37153,1.0,"David Winmill is excellent - very personable and friendly, very knowledgeable. ",1
4037,37153,1.0,"I am glad I stumbled upon this site! I have been recommending Mr. Winmill at the IHC Clinic for awhile now. Now I can do it officially. He has a wonderful personality that makes you feel comfortable, especially when you are not feeling so hot. He is patient and listens to your issues before he decides what advice and treatment will work for me. If you have Diebetes, he is the best I know of. David Winmill is a great Nurse Practioner. You won't be disappointed! ",1
4038,37153,1.0,Very well organized and thorough. Has my daughters' diabetes under control.  ,1

4040,37153,1.0,"Went to him with type 2 diabetes, he tested me for cushings disease... I was so worried and didnt hear anything for a month. Then when I finally got a hold of his assistant she told me the test confirmed it and that i needed to make an appt for the next steps...  So i did then i went in there to see him and was way freaked out at the thought of having a tumor on my pituitary gland and he was like &quot;you dont have cushings&quot; and i was crying WHAT&#63; a month of my life believeing i would have to have brain surgery because they gave me the wrong results&#63; HOrrible!

4041,37154,0.0,"Dr. Walker is great. She delivered both of my babies and was excellent.My first child was premature and Dr. Walker was wonderful taking care of both me and my child. My second child was born in Jan. 2008 and everything was perfect, because of my previos complications she kept a close eye on me and we had a smooth ride. And if I have ever had to wait for her the office staff has been great about letting me know what was going on and how long it might be. ",1
4042,37154,0.0,"She is very popular so I need to wait for a long time, sometimes 2 hrs or re-schedule but it's worth it. She is very friendly and make me feel so comfortable to ask question and etc.I'd defenitely recommend her if you have right insurance. Her nurses are also very nice and easy to talk to. ",1
4043,37154,0.0,This doctor is all about delivering babies. During our delivery she made mutliple comments about how long it was taking. She made the delivery feel like just another day at work and nothing special. ,-1
4044,37154,0.0,"I feel very comfortable with Dr. Walker if something were to go wrong with the pregnancy. She is very knowledgeable; however, she is also very busy and you will literally wait 2 hours sometimes when waiting to see her. This also means that when you do finally see her she does not spend a whole lot of time with you. You have to come prepared with written questions or it seems she does not have the patience to just talk to you. If you are looking for an OBGYN who sits down with you and gives you a lot of time and support; especially for new moms I would not recommend her. If you dont need someone to tell you all the things that are going on in your pregnancy and you want someone very knowledgeable or have difficult pregnancies then I would recommend Dr. Walker. ",1
4045,37155,1.0,"Excellant Doctor. He's very thorough, likable and sensible. ",1
4046,37155,1.0,"Dr. White is an amazing doctor -- if you can get in to see him.  You can be on your death bed and his next appointment is the following week.  I like his M.A., but the rest of the staff is not very helpful.  Good luck in getting him to call you back.  If all you need is a physical and can wait three months to get in, he's a great doctor.  If you are sick, find someone else. ",1
4047,37155,1.0,"Picks up weird problems better than specialists we've been to.  Very personable and caring.  Great doc.      Office staff is crabby like most recepionists and you do end up waiting to long, but we keep going back because Dr. White is fabulous! ",1

4049,37156,1.0,"I had Dr Wilde for my entire pregnancy. I chose him based upon him caring for my son in the ER. He actually is a resident, about to finish. I wish he was staying here because my husband and I would use him as our family doctor as long as we lived here. He caught symptoms that other nurses or doctors didn't see as a big deal - which turned out to be. He listens well to your concerns and if he doesn't know 100% at the time for a complication, he finds it out and calls you up. He follows up in a timely manner, treats your opinion with respect and never overlooks something that concerns you. The staff is not his fault because it's a practice with many doctors under their roof and they're not the best.  ",1
4050,37156,1.0,"He is pleasant yet awkward and quirky at times.  However, probably fairly knowledgeable. Kinda acts like a cowboy though.  I think he is a resident doctor in training.  I would refer my wife to him if she was pregnant for sure.  ",1
4051,37157,1.0,"I went to Dr. Wilding for years in my youth (age 11 to 18, approximately). He is very personable with all age groups and definitely knows his medicine. He even has the unique talent of making some illnesses and/or treatments seem entertaining instead of bothersome or frightening. He always seems to be in a hurry, but he listens to concerns and answers questions and is always genuinely focused on the well-being of his patients. He'll even recognize faces after a while and greet patients if he sees them outside of the clinic setting. ",1
4052,37157,1.0,My grandson who is 3 was very sick. We couldn't get into his regular doctor so they worked him in to see Dr Wilding. He was very good with my grandson although he did have to have blood work and a shot. Dr wilding is very good with kids and put Ky at ease. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a good doctor in the Brigham City area. ,1
4053,37159,1.0,"Excellent surgeon, extremely happy with the results of my proceedures.  It turned out better than I had hoped and I am so happy.  I found him to be reasonably priced for the area.  His staff was supportive and excellent with follow up.  He spent the time needed with me and checked on me after surgery.  Really pleased.  I am and RN and have been around many MDs.  He is a very intelligent and artistic MD.  Highly recommend this MD. ",1
4054,37159,1.0,"Wonderful bedside manor! A Plastic surgeon who cares more about people then money is rare but he is one of them and also does a great job! Also ethics, it was hard to find a surgeon who doesn't have criminal charges or sleeps with patients or married woman. Look into what kind of surgeon your supporting people! ",1
4055,37159,1.0,"I LOVED my experience with Dr. Warnock and his office. I had breast augmentation surgery and everything went so much better than expected. Dr. Warnock really takes time to explain the procedure, answer questions, and give his professional experienced opinion. I also LOVED his PA! Ask about cash discount and early booking. I reccommend him to my friends! ",1
4056,37159,1.0,"He's so incredibly HOT! Ok, now that's out of the way. I am loving my tummy tuck. I had TT and lipo of hips about 2 and a half weeks ago. And I love my abs, the suturing is amazing, comparing it to my c-section scar, his sutures are almost non-existent.  And he is all that the reviews say he is, he listens, and did I mention he 's incredibly hot...lol..ok ",1
4057,37159,1.0,"Great experience with Dr. Warnock he is very professional, patient, he listens, comfortable environment, honest, provides full disclosure of risks, affordable, concern for patients health (he was the only plastic surgeon out of 12 that wanted me to get a mammogram before having a BA/BL).

4058,37159,1.0,"The reviews here helped me initially choose Dr. Warnock, so I thought I would return and help someone else decide.  Dr. Warnock is an exceptionally skilled and compassionate surgeon.  He took time to listen to me and help me through the process.  I felt completely comfortable with him and would highly recommend him to anyone.  I also enjoyed working with Dana.  She was down to earth, and I felt like she was my friend through everything. ",1
4059,37159,1.0,"I interviewed 6 plastic surgeons before I decided on Dr. Warnock.  He was kind, respectful, and skilled. In addition, he was the least expensive and most trustworthy of the surgeons I interviewed. His office staff is amazing as well, especially Hayley, who went above and beyond while helping me deal with a billing issue.  I was so happy with what he did for me that I had him do craniofacial surgery on my daughter as well.  She has a rare condition that required difficult surgery, and he did it beautifully and competently.  I am thrilled with the outcome and would recommend him to everyone. ",1
4060,37159,1.0,I used him as a plastic surgean to repair my son's cleft. He is very knowlegable about the re-pair and is very good at involving the parents. ,1

Along with his knowledge and expertise he always would make our child smile and giggle. When you have a child that struggles with problems, its especially important to have a physician that cares about the patient. He also uses the best prosthesis company in the Salt Lake Valley. Highly recommended.  ",1
4063,37159,1.0,Dr. Warnock has a fabulous bedside manner and makes everyone feel comfortable.  I actually see him for my son who has a bilateral cleft lip and palate that he is repairing and feel very capable in his hands. He is very knowledgeable and extremely skilled.  I can't tell you the number of comments we have received about his superior work on fixing my son's lip.  ,1
4064,37159,1.0,"Dr. Warnock is absolutely amazing! His work speaks for itself,(visit his website!), and he's not arrogant like some of the other Dr's I checked out. My husband and I are SO happy with his work!!! I would recommend Dr. Warnock to everyone interested in plastic surgery! One thing to note is that he tends to err on the side of caution, so if you're going in for a breast augmentation like I did, he will recommend you go smaller rather than too large. In his opinion, 'B' is the perfect size. =) I went with a large 'C', small 'D', and I am soooo happy with how they look and feel! He really is amazing!!! ",1

4075,37164,0.0,Michelle caused me more pain and it didn't get better until I saw a physical therapist who said Michelle did the wrong thing for me. My insurance pays for a chiropractor but this place is cash only. Michelle didn't do anything for my back until a couple times I went after she told me it would be thousands of dollars that could be paid upfront for a discount. It was a very bad experience. ,-1
4076,37165,1.0,He is very knowledgeable and gives answers to questions asked but if you don't know what questions to ask than no info is given. Seems shy which can be mistaken for poor bedside manners. Sometimes he side steps non oncology related issues instead of helping. Over all he's trying to cure my cancer so he gets a pat on the back for that. ,1
4077,37166,1.0,This Doctor was the best doctor I have ever been to.  He was fast and so unbelievably friendly.  He genuinely cared about my recovery and was always checking in on me.  I recommend him to everyone! ,1
4078,37166,1.0,"THIS DR. COULDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HIS PATIENTS! We were on time for our appointment. Took care of the paperwork and co-pay. We were told that patients were seen in the order that they arrived. Many people arrived after we did. We waited a total of 90 minutes to see the dr. After about 80 min. I asked the assistant how long the wait would be from here. She said she would let him know. After she reminded him, he still stood in an alcove next to our room talking to a PT about cinnamon rolls and square footage of another building. He heard me talk to his assistant about the time yet we waited another 10 min. then left. We went to the front desk to get our co-pay refunded. All the other patients that were there after us were GONE! During that time, the dr. didn't have the balls to come out and apologize to us. He hid behind the corner until we left (I looked back as we were leaving and saw him come out from his hiding place). This Ortho needs to grow HIMSELF a spine. ",-1
4079,37167,0.0,"I think Karan is absolutely amazing. In regards to the person who had to wait a half hour, this occurs because she takes her time with her patients. I would rather wait a half hour for a full session than a rushed 15 minutes. Karan takes her time with me, listens to my concerns, and has a wonderful attitude. I am bipolar, and she has been wonderful working with me, trying out new medications. She makes me feel like I am a partner for my disability, instead of just a patient. ",1
4080,37167,0.0,After the birth of my first child I had post partum depression and have never really seemed to have kicked it.  I let my OB/Gyn treat my depression without any real break through for years then I decided to go to a real mental health care provider.  Karan diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder which made a lot more sense and got me on proper medication and I am now able to see the light at the end tunnel!  Anxiety disorder makes a lot more sense to me then depression so that lets me be able to deal with it better.  I have never had to wait but wouldn't mind because there is obviously someone ahead of me that is in great need to keep her longer.  ,1
4081,37167,0.0,"I love her!!! I initially began seeing her several years ago, but stopped because I thought I was &quot;all better&quot; and therefore thought I would be OK without meds. I was very wrong. When I decided to seek help again, I saw a few psychiatrists closer to my house. I have come to the conclusion that I would much rather drive thirty miles to see someone exceptional rather than drive five miles to see someone less than mediocre. When I decided to see her again, the only downside was that I had to wait over to months to get a &quot;new patient&quot; appointment because it had been over two years since I had last been. It was well worth the wait! As a fellow medical professional, it's easy to separate those who really Care about their patients from those who do not. Karan definitely cares. When I have all but given up on myself, she still hasn't given up on me. She works very hard to find a combination of meds that works for you.

4082,37167,0.0,"This was a new patient appointment scheduled for 10:00 a.m.  She finally came out at 10:35 a.m. and I explained that I almost left because of the delay.  She said &quot;this is the way I run my practice and always run late so maybe I should schedule with another Doctor.&quot;  When I explained that I had other things to do she finally said she was sorry, that If this was going to be a problem that I should see someone else.  I said okay and went back out to the receptionist, got my co-pay back and left.  It took me 2 months to get this appointment and I was not going to wait for another 2 months for someone at that facility.  ",-1

4088,37170,1.0,"Dr. Wahlen is very knowledgeable about Diabetes, but treats his patients like you are nothing to him. Very judgemental and accusing, horrible bedside manner. Was a great Doctor when I was diagnosed with Diabetes in 1982, but has since let his practice suffer.  ",1

4090,37171,0.0,Catherine is wonderful. I went in for a consultation for a procedure last week. She related to my hobbies which made me very comfortable. She is so compassionate.  I think i will continue with her for a long time! I have referred her to a family member who is have pregnancy issues and will refer her to anyone i know! ,1
4091,37171,0.0,"Dr. Wheeler is the best!  I am very picky about medical providers.  She is that rare combination of knowledge and compassion.  She is very kind and takes time to really address concerns.  She is also very conservative in her treatment plans, which I love.  I felt like my baby was in the best hands possible.  She is no longer delivering babies, which is disheartening.  I'm hoping that someone else in her practice is close to the equivalent of Dr. Wheeler.  ",1
4092,37171,0.0,"She was my very first OBGYN. She was understanding and kind to me because she knew I was nervous. She has a lot of OB patients and they consume most of her time, but her nurse practitioners and staff are helpful. If there was ever a concern she would handle it herself. She is fairly young and relates well with young patients. I would have never changed doctors, but my insurance no longer covers her. Highly recommended. ",1
4093,37172,1.0,Dr. Watts is amazing.  He delivered my second child which was a high risk pregnancy and I felt that I was very well taken care of.  His bedside manner is wonderful.  He is very kind and knowledgeable.  I have since moved to Florida with horrible healthcare and am seriously considering flying back for any future checkups/deliveries.  It is so rare to find a good Dr. like this anymore.  Thanks Dr. Watts! ,1
4094,37172,1.0,"He is a very good Dr! I will be going back to him with any other pregnancies. On punctuality, I gave a 2 because my appointments are never on time. I wait about 30 min (sometimes more) over my time in the waiting room then another 20 mins or so in the exam room. When pregnant, that is the most uncomfortable thing. It may be the schedulers who are scheduling to many people to close together. The staff, I gave a 4 due to the amount of time it takes to call me back after I have to leave a message to talk to them with concerns. But overall, the staff members are nice and helpful. The lady in the front with cool hair is ALWAYS nice and helpful. I just love checking out with her...great attitude and always makes you feel welcome at that office.  ",1
4095,37172,1.0,"I have been impressed with Dr. Watts and his staff, I changed from a different doctor and he worked me in to help with my care he was able to assess the problem when other doctors couldn't.  His staff is always concerned and answers questions if they don't have the answer they talk to Dr. Watts.  If I need an appointment they get me in quickly.  I have had 1 visit where I had to wait a while but I expect to have to wait when I go to a doctor's office.  Over all I am very pleased with the care. ",1
4096,37172,1.0,"I could suggest not to go that clinic at all. I waited outside for more than half house in March. Finally went inside waited doctor for another almost one hour. The the assist ordered wrong Mammogram test for breast lump. The insurance didn't pay the bill, their billing person agreed to discount in Aug if I pay the bill. They refused the discount as of today. The doctor visit is not cheap and all the stresses after the visit.  ",-1
4097,37172,1.0,"Dr. Watts is an amazing doctor and I love his 2 medical assistants. I followed him from the U and he delivered my first child; my insurance is changing next year and I can't have him as my OB anymore, which makes me very sad. I have referred him to few others and they have all loved him as well. He's an OB who delivers and has emergency cases at times so if he's late or appt has to be rescheduled, that should be understandable! ",1
4098,37172,1.0,"Dr. Watts is great.  He is very understanding and takes the time to listen to issues that you may have.  His bedside manner is great as well.  He called me himself with test results while he was on vacation.  Some, NOT ALL of the medical assistants could be a little nicer. I would highly recommend him to anyone. ",1
4099,37172,1.0,"I had to go to Doctor Watts for a D&C; when my insurance didn't cover the hospital where my doctor at the time worked. The first time I met him was pre-op. He was so great, I never returned to my old doctor. He always remembers my name. He called me personally after the D&C; to check on me and gave me his cell phone number to reach him. He is thorough, honest and knowledgeable.  I would recommend him to everyone! ",1
4100,37172,1.0,"Dr. Watts is kind and fun, but in a hurry and more likely to prescribe medicine than talk about your condition and explore what is going on. He won't remember your delivery experience when you come in for postpartum. Be ready to fire off questions before he rushes off to the next patient. I was in pain after he checked me for prenatal dilation and effacement, but rather than help me through it, Dr. Watts talked about a book he was reading as I cringed in discomfort. When I was in pain after he put in my IUD, he washed his hands, put some info into the computer, and rushed off to the next patient. Nurses are young and cold.  Office needs redecorating.  ",-1
4101,37172,1.0,"I love Dr. Watts himself, he's great and helpful and has helped me get to the root of my problems. He has great bedside manner and makes me feel very comfortable. However, I may end up leaving his office simply because of the staff. I've had several frustrating experiences and getting an appointment is always very far in advance. They have a huge problem with giving you the run-around just to schedule an appointment, and then half the time you get rescheduled after you show up. When I do have a concern, I have been blown off and I've actually been told, &quot;I'm too busy to help you right now, call back tomorrow.&quot; I don't even think I'm very needy, I usually just need a prescription refill.

4103,37172,1.0,"I had seen Dr. Watts before but I lived farther away so didn't go to him &quot;regularly.&quot; I have since moved and decided to go to him since he knew my history.  Now whe I go to see him, he has totally diregarded what I say, and tells me to &quot;keep doing what I'm doing.&quot;  I wouldn't be asking him about things if I all I wanted to hear was to keep doing what I'm doing.  I would have recommended him before, but now would not recommend him to anyone I care about.  He does not have a very good bedside manner, and I feel I'm always shrugged off whenever I call, or come in to see him! ",-1
4104,37172,1.0,Dr. Watts is the best ever. My daughter was born at 28 weeks and it was a stressful day but Dr. Watts was right there to ease my stress and let me know I was going to be ok.  I would follow him to any pratice and I tell all my friends that they should see him.  I have had many procudures with him and he always has the best bedside mannor.  ,1

4107,37172,1.0,I have been seeing Dr. Watts for 6 years and even changed clinics to continue seeing him. He is extremely personable and cares about his patients. I was very impressed when he called me directly with my lab results (which were normal).  HE called ME - he is the BEST!!! ,1
4108,37172,1.0,The best doctor I have ever seen. My husband adores him as well. He delivered both of our girls and we cannot say enough good about him. He is compassionate and caring. His bedside manner is impecable. I would recommend him to anybody. In fact we went to him after he left the University hospital at a cost to us of $500 deductible that otherwise wouldn't have existed had we stayed at the university. He is the BEST!!! ,1

I had a tooth that had been bothering me everytime I drank something cold.  One dentist told me that it &quot;probably&quot; needed a root canal.  Dr. Walker said that it didn't respond like teeth that normally need root canals. He put a filling in it and I haven't had sensitivity since!  He's great!  I definitely recommend him.  ",1

She has a tv room and tons of toys throughout her office to keep your little ones busy during your check ups. She also has a lock kids cant get to so they are nice and safe, she always locks the door during your visit so that's nice you get a lot of one on one time and all appointments are an hour so no rush like a normal doctors office.

He is not a patient man but that is more his nature I believe rather than rudeness. He does want to help and I recommend him to anyone in need of a great neurosurgeon. I met people he did brain surgery on and they all had high praise for him as well. His assistant Lauren Archuletta is great. His other assistant I dislike very much. Other than than, no negatives.

4138,37183,1.0,My wife and I have been going to Dr. williams for 25 years. We have found him to be the best family doctor in Utah. He is really patient and cares for his patients. My wife has had several health problems over the years and Dr. Willaims has bee very knowlageable and helpful. Since he was hurt a few years ago he understands what his patients are going though and he really wants to help people get better.  ,1
4139,37183,1.0,"Dr. Williams prescribed the wrong dosage on perscription and despite all the visits & phone calls of complaints of fainting & dizziness he did nothing until it was so bad my mother was hospitalized and irreversable damage had occured.  He admitted that it was his error but that was the extent of it.  We finally talked her into going to a different doctor, who took care to make sure her meds were performing well with few side effects.  Later, she had a reaction to an antibiotic and her new doctor was out of town so she went back to Dr. Williams.  He's now been playing with her meds for months but none of her issues are ever undercontrol like they were with the other doctor.  Dr. Williams changes her meds every other month and doesn't seem to know how to really pinpoint the right meds at the right dosages.  He seems nice, but he is not a very competant doctor in my opinion.  We try to get my mother back to the other doctor but she feels guilty leaving Williams now.  ",-1

4141,37184,1.0,The thing people have to realize about Rheumatology is that auto immune diseases are extremely hard to diagnose. Dr Walker doesn't have the best bed side manners but he seems to genuinely care about his paitients. I went into see him and at the time there was nothing to diagnose me with so I got a 2nd opinion. I was such a rare and special case that there was no way he could've found it at the time I saw him. Overall he is a pretty good doctor. ,1
4142,37184,1.0,I went in to see doctor Walker for unexplainable body pain. I thought I may have fibromyalgia and after some tests he said it looks like it might be that. He gave me a brochure and told me to exercise. Not very helpful in treating pain.  ,-1
4143,37184,1.0,"While in extreme bone crushing pain I asked for a note for work so that I could go back when I am capable of performing job duties without passing out or throwing up.  This &quot;professional&quot; told me &quot;no&quot; and that I had to be &quot;a contributing member of society.&quot;  I was already depressed because of the pain and my limitations - the last thing I needed was my doctor telling me that needing time off made me worthless.  I was crying and he sat back with a smug look on his face the whole time, just sure he was right and had been appropriate.  I would warn anyone against seeing him. ",-1
4144,37185,1.0,"1st time visit.  Not particularly impressed. I went in thinking that perhaps I had plantar fasciitis, he agreed. He was very much in a hurry, did answered the questions I asked but did not offer any new explanation/education or additional information. Sent me out with an insert for my shoes and for the exercises I thought he was going to have the assistant show me some, but instead I got a handout with some pictures and explanations. Nothing wrong with his personality, but I was not impressed. At the very least he could have taken the time (perhaps 2 more minutes if that) to show me the exercises instead of giving me a piece of paper. ",-1
4145,37185,1.0,My daughter received treatment for fractured metatarsals and received excellent care.  We would definitely use Dr. Weenig again.  ,1
4146,37185,1.0,"I saw Doctor Weenig for neck and back and hip pain.  It's been a problem for years.  I am only 23 years old. I mentioned that my legs looked like they were different lengths and that when I used to see a chiropracter they always shoved a bone in my lower left back, up into place.  It would soon slip out again. Weenig measured my legs, it turns out they are different lengths.  He took an exray of my pelvic area- sure enough it was very tilted. He didn't talk to me about cure options-It was something I had to keep mentioning and it seemed like he didn't care or didn't know other options. He gave me a shoe insert that I could have bought at walmart, told me to wear it in my right shoe, sent me home. My pain didn't heal. I went back, had to ask for a neck x-ray which came out black. He lightened it enough to barely see the tips of the neck spine, couldn't see any other part of the neck bones. he gave me another shoe insert, sent me home, charged me 150.00 again. It seemed he was in a hurry ",-1
4147,37186,1.0,"Great surgeon, but he did not listen to me and I ended up being misdiagnosed because of it. After doing everything he asked, and having my symptoms get worse I went to Salt Lake and found a doctor who would treat me for the symptoms I was ACTUALLY having, not the symptoms he THOUGHT I was having. Dr. Wang and his partner are the only electrophysiologists in Utah County, but go to Salt Lake. It's worth the drive! I would not recommend him. ",-1

4165,37196,1.0,"I was involved in a terrible accident back on 1993 on I-15. My first Doctor told me I would need surgery to stabilize my shoulder. Well after 10 procedures the WC insurance allowed me to go to another surgeon. I ran into a person at the grocery store who told me to call Dr. West. Dr. West's office staff gave me an appointment the next day. Dr. West talked with my wife and I for over 2 hours, and we left his office with a plan in place to fix my shoulder for good. The next Thursday he scoped the shoulder and after I was out of the recovery room told me that with mine and my wifes permission he wanted to go back in right then to try to fix what the other surgeon had faild to do. Doctor West was honest with me that he thought the surgury would fail, but he had to try as the only other option was to fuse the joint. It did and yes he had to fuse the joint,but he did with more courage then I had,and after 10 years later he calls to check up on me. Doctor Hugh West is a great Man and Surgeon.  ",1
4166,37196,1.0,"Dr West is for sure one of the best. He repaired my acl and like a previous reviewer stated, I don't need a brace either. In another incident I had a dirtbike accident and injured my shoulder with a partial tear of the rotator cuff. We often hear of surgeons who are quick to cut. Dr West said it could possibly need surgery but wanted to go the physical therapy and time route. He was right and my shoulder is fine. This guy is very friendly and I am thankful to have him as my doctor. ",1
4167,37196,1.0,"Seemed unconcerned about my wife's frozen shoulder. Initially had an MRI on her shoulder. The radiologist pointed at a &quot;spot&quot; that he said was the problem. West told us that &quot;sometimes radiologists can't read films right&quot;. That should've been a warning. He did a procedure which only worsened her pain. He didn't care. He stood behind his treatment, refused to listen, and forced her into PT that actually made it worse. He wrote a grand total of 60 pain pills in 4 months. His staff treated her like she was an addict. My wife is tough, NEVER takes pain pills. She doesn't like the feeling they give her. She needed surgery and pain relief. When she called to request a few pain pills to get her through a holiday weekend, staff members waited until they were closed, left a message to make an appt 3 WEEKS LATER. We found a REAL surgeon, he agreed with the radiologist, fixed the problem, she's better now. This CLOWN has MALPRACTICE written all over him.  How do ppl like this live with themselves&#63; ",-1

4171,37197,1.0,"Despite being a patient for several months, I have yet to actually meet Dr. Wilson.  The limited office hours have made it extremely difficult to come in.  They are not open before 9 am, close for 1 1/2 hours for lunch, and close the office at 4:00 pm.  (They are also closed all day Friday) Good luck getting in if you work...  I will also mention that one member of their staff makes you feel completely unwelcome and that the smallest request is a great burden.  This week I was feeling quite ill and needed to go in.  Not only was I unable to find anybody in the office for an entire day, but they never even returned my call.  Needless to say, I am now looking for a new provider. ",-1
4172,37197,1.0,"Dr. Sam Wilson and his staff are very knowledgeable at what they do and they are very professional.  My family and I have been going to Dr. Sam Wilson ever since I was about two years old, which is about 20 years now! We have never had any problems with him, he is always very understanding and knows what he's talking about.  He actually listens to your concerns.  I've gone to Dr. Sam Wilson to everything from a fever to PTSD trauma concerns, and I've never felt like he hasn't listened to me, my concerns, and my physical symptoms.  I'd recommend Dr.  Sam Wilson to anyone who is in need of a doctor that takes his time to understand your concerns and won't be condenscending, while also being very great at what he does and very knowledgeable!

4174,37197,1.0,"I have been going to Dr. Wilson for about 20 years.  I find him to be a very upbeat, kind person and very helpful.  I have a cronic disease and he has helped with with it and learned to cope with it.  I do agree with the issues he has with his staff.  They don't seem like they are there to help the patient, especially his receptionist.  She isn't very welcoming or warm.  It seems to me you need a kid person to work in a Dr's office.  People are there because they need help or are sick.  They don't want to be made to feel like they are imposing.  It's the patients that are paying their paycheck. ",1
4175,37197,1.0,"I love love love Dr. Wilson. The kindest, gentle, patient, most concerned man that I have ever met in my life. Been a patient for 20 yrs.... I HATE his VERY RUDE unprofessional and short staff!! The few he had like Angie of course leave and the redhead behind the front desk is absolutely a nightmare. It's been this way for 20 yrs. He needs to get rid of the friends and relatives who do nothing but eat eat eat  and get some professional help. They are more concerned ALWAYS abut stuffing their fat faces with pizza, chocolate and sharing recipes than doing their job and helping the public patients. I love Dr.  Sam, but he needs to clean house and get a serious makeover with the ****y, clueless, women staff!!! :( ",1
4176,37197,1.0,"Dr. Wilson has done a good job for me and my family.  When required, he has referred us to specialists that also provided good service (although their &quot;bedside&quot; manner is seldom as good as Dr. Wilson's). I have found his staff to be helpful.  There's usually many pill-pushers calling on him, so there is always a lot going on.  I recommend Dr. Wilson to my friends. ",1
4177,37197,1.0,We met Dr Wilson for the first time in the Emergency Room at Lakeview. We waited for him to open his practice and have been with him for over 25 years now. The wait can be long but worth every second because he never rushes you either. He is happy and jokey during uncomfortable situations. I don't understand the logic in some of these comments about the staff because they have been incredibly kind every time I go in. They have gone out of their way to fill a prescpription that was called in late by husband many times. I am always greeted with a smile and a warm welcome from Dr. Wilson. He is willing to give samples when possible and to refer me to other doctors if needed. I miss his nurse Angie that used to work there. She was the best! Don't ever retire Dr. Wilson until I am long gone!!! ,1
4178,37197,1.0,The best Dr. I have ever had.  Dr Wislon is willing to go the extra mile to help me.  ,1
4179,37197,1.0,I have gone to Dr. Wilson for over 20 years he has delivered all three of my babies. When we come in for our yearly visits he treats the kids like his own grandchildren and they love him. In the past when we have had serious health issues we have gone to a specialist and not been happy with the results so we went to Dr. Wilson and he has always solved our problems. He is not always on time because he takes the time to answer all your questions. I don't get upset because I know I will get my time too. I feel Dr. Wilson has a real talent to heal.  I have referred him to friends with issues that could not be solved by other doctors and he figures it out right away :) ,1

4181,37197,1.0,"Dr. Wilson is very helpful and knowledgeable! He has been our family physician for over two decades!

4182,37197,1.0,"Waited upwards of 3 hours - Staff is often gone -I would not recommend him because he did not address my concerns with his recommended treatment, which ended up causing me a lot of pain. ",-1
4183,37197,1.0,"If you can get passed the front desk to see him, it's totally worth it.  His staff have never really been helpful, but I find Dr. Wilson's expertise to be outstanding.  He is an exceptional, personable doctor with a great bedside manner.  ",1
4184,37197,1.0,I do not like Dr. Wilson's staff at all. The only reason I continue to go is because I feel that Dr. Wilson gives great care and is very knowledgeable. I have had a lot of problems with the front desk not only as a patient but also on a professional level calling on behalf on another physician's office located near his office.  ,1
4185,37197,1.0,"Sometimes a message left with staff is not relayed to Dr. Wilson correctly (if detailed). Sometimes it's better to make an appointment to tell him yourself. Other than that, I've found the staff to be helpful & considerate. Dr. Wilson is a very knowledgeable, compassionate physician. He takes the time to address and treat health issues. This can result in a lack of punctuality. I've been his patient for 16 years. He knows my health history well. He listens to his patients, takes into consideration their self evaluation of their condition and has been open to alternative remedies (such as herbs). His sunny disposition is &quot;contagious&quot; :-) I've been very pleased with his ability to diagnose and treat my multiple health issues, one of which has been life threatening. Since I've been with him, stabilized and followed his treatment plan, my visits to his office are mostly for routine yearly tests. Thank you for keeping me alive and well.  ",1
4186,37198,1.0,"Dr. Daren Winn is a fantastic Dr. My son and I both go to him.  He always listens, and does not make you feel like you are crazy.  He is very up to date on things, and will listen if you have an idea or suggestion.  Dr. Winn makes you feel like a team working together.  After seeing numerous Dr's over the past year he is the first one to listen, and cares to follow up on test results that are not normal.  He is an Excellent Dr.  ",1

4194,37202,0.0,"After experiencing progressively worsening flu-like symptoms for two weeks and developing a deep, productive cough, I made an appointment with Dr. Wells. I told her my symptoms, and she told me &quot;from the way you smell, I can tell you have strep throat.&quot; I thought this was strange, because I didn't have any throat pain.  She left the room, and I expected her to come back to perform a throat culture.  After about ten minutes of waiting, one of her staff walked in the exam room, and was surprised to see me there; she informed me that Dr. Wells was finished with her examination, despite having never cultured my throat.  My symptoms worsened, and I wound up in the emergency room two days later - the ER physicians found I had pneumonia (with no signs of strep).  Dr. Wells performed a grossly incomplete examination and failed to diagnose a serious illness.  Her inability to perform even a basic throat culture leaves me quite dubious as to her capacity as a medical practitioner. ",-1

4201,37207,1.0,Dr Wilde is awesome.  He's done 2 surgeries on me and delivered my baby.  He always takes time to talk after an exam to explore options and answer questions.  He has been my doctor for over 10 years.  ,1
4202,37207,1.0,Dr. Wilde is great. I was referred to him for surgery and very pleased with his professionalism and comprehensive review of my options.  He asked me a lot of questions to find out what would work best for me.  ,1
4203,37208,1.0,His bedside manner is great. He actually listens! He's willing to go the extra mile for you. He calls and follows up when he says he will. I've never felt &quot;rushed&quot; during the office visits.  ,1
4204,37209,1.0,"LOVE Dr. Wall. I've been seeing him for the last few weeks as I've been recovering from a pregnancy. This has been my easiest recovery ever, by far (and I'm on baby number 5)!

4206,37210,1.0,"My first impression of doctor Williams is much like others described, in a hurry, friendly, likes to joke, but doesn't linger. Although, friendly, I  felt like he was in a hurry to get to his next patient, and once we were done had no more time for me or my son.  His staff was professional, but distant.  I just rolled with it, and was eager to try his recommendations.  When we continued to have problems and  i tried to contact him again, it was very, very difficult.  Then we moved to another country where it is difficult to find physicians, especially specialists.  I called his office to see if they could work with us over the internet or through Skype perhaps.  Obviously feeling a little desperate here.  I could accept if he could not do it, but might have at least like to have heard a little compassion communicated from his office.  They were indifferent in their response, almost like they were robots reporting the facts.  I wont return, and won't recommend him to family or friends. ",-1

4208,37210,1.0,"I will not go back. His sense of humor I could deal with, although I felt as though he talked down to me.  The staff was not very friendly or helpful, didn't really even acknowledge I was in the room. I have had moles removed in the past with minimal scarring. He didn't really explain the procedure to me, just that I would need it done immediately. While done excising the mole he ran in and out of the room and let his PA-C suture me up while he started on another patient. I am pretty young still and will be scarred for life. If you need something removed he doesn't care about cosmetic looks at all and how it will effect the patient in the long run.   See someone else! ",1

I went to see him about removing a mole on my face (you can imagine the degrading feeling I had just going in for that reason) He was late, and treated me like a child. On top of that he poked at my face rudely, then right before I left he pushed on my facial mole and jiggled it while making childish noises for his own amusement! I slapped his hand away and tried to hide my humiliation. It wasn't until I got to the car that I started crying. Don't you think that a doctor, especially a dermatologist, should be more sensitive to people's feelings&#63; I will not be returning.  ",-1

He is touchy-feely and tries to crack jokes whenever he can, but he made sure to answer all my questions and was serious enough about doing his job. ",1
4216,37210,1.0,"Dr. Williams is definitely energetic and humorous, but I didn't feel it effects his thoroughness in any way.  My 15-year old son also saw him, and the humor aided my son in wanting to control his acne which was heading to scaring.  Without that fun approach, my son wouldn't have cared or even listened.  Dr. Williams didn't push expensive things on me (only told me about botox after I asked), and answered all questions quickly but thoroughly.  He is great!  The energy and humor is just his style.  He is almost 40, but looks 28...so he must be doing something right.  ",1
4217,37210,1.0,"Horrible bedside manner!!! I would never recommend this doctor!! He was completely unprofessional, did not explain the side effect of the procedure until after he did the procedure. If I would have known the risk/outcome, I would never have let him proceed! ",-1
4218,37210,1.0,"I have several children going to Dr. Williams for acne problems.  We mostly see his PA who is great.

4219,37210,1.0,Very knowlegable and pleasant.   I was a bit nervous and his great sense of humor helped a lot ,1
4220,37210,1.0,Dr Williams was great.  He was very humorous.  He was in and out of the room quickly but it I didn't feel neglected at all!  My only problem with the visit was that I didn't get seen until an hour after my appt time. ,1
4221,37210,1.0,"I wouldn,t make an appointment with him again, he wasn't very helpful only cared about selling other expensive procedures like botox.  I agree with other rating he acts too young.  If I come in for botox thats fine otherwise mind your own business Dr. Williams, its offensive. ",1
4222,37210,1.0,"He is quick, thorough and to the point all the while making you laugh. Not the doctor if you need someone to hold your hand and talk (that's a psychologist). He has a great PA and he helps the balancing act allowing the dr. more time.  ",1

4225,37210,1.0,"He is friendly, but he is too touchy feely and when he talks to you he gets really close to your face.  I think hes looking for things he can make money on. He was trying to talk me into botox on my forehead, which I don't need I'm only early 40's.  He actually made me very uncomfortable, he was also very hyper like a little kid jumping on his hands in his chair.  I would only go back to his pa, but not him. ",1
4226,37210,1.0,"Good bedside manners. Always cheerful, even at the end of the day. Although can be kind of fast in and out of the room so I forgot to ask some questions I had. Overall, would recommend Dr Williams to everyone. ",1

After 9 hours of continuous screaming, I called him. This was to be fourth child circumcized, so I realized this was abnormal. He basically said that it was going to be painful, and that it was normal. Instict told me it was NOT! I found out that the tip of the penis was strangulating and he was unable to urinate. He was sent by ambulance to Primary Children's Hospital where they removed the string and plastibel from his enormously swollen penis! He is now 20 months old (uncircumcised) things are still not right. We have moved from the state now, but this doctors license needs revoked! I am thankful that the damage wasn't worse, if I had listened to him, there would have been permanent nerve damage. I am not the type to file a law suit, but it should have been done! Just be aware!

4237,37216,0.0,I have seen her for four years for migraines. The first appointment was satisfying because she understands migraines better than anyone else I've paid to listen to me.She had no front office bimbos with big hair that take your blood pressure. She gives you one on one time.She told me that she learns more from patients about headaches by seeing them one on one.She also expects you to take responsibility for your condition (most doc's don't do this) so many would not feel as &quot;taken care of&quot; by her.I have referred many different clients to her.  ,1
4238,37216,0.0,"I'm surprised at the negative ratings.  I think she likes to completely hear what your symptons are without hearing self proscribed treatment and diagnosis.

4239,37216,0.0,Rude and condescending.  Has the worst repoire with patients ever.

He cares for both the physical and emotional well being of his patients and doesn't just quickly prescribe something textbook before really understanding the  person's own problem.

4257,37223,1.0,"Dr. Watabe was not my regular doctor but he ended up delivering my baby because my doctor was out of town.  I loved him!  He was so courteous and friendly and he helped me be as comfortable as I could when delivering.  He treated my husband and I, along with the hospital nurses with respect.  I would go back to him again.  ",1
4258,37223,1.0,"I didn't have Dr. Watabe as my OB, but he was a doctor at my OB office and happened to be the one to deliver my second baby. Everything went well, he really knew what he was doing. Dr. Watabe also informed me on what was going on so that I could be involved and make decisions for myself. Very kind and I would recommend from the positive experience I had with him.  ",1
4259,37223,1.0,"I love Doctor Watabe! I trust him completely. He just delivered my first baby via c-section. He recommended a c-section but let me decide what I wanted to do. I took his advice, and it was a good thing I did; my baby would've torn me apart, and I was thankful for his foresight. Extremely competent and very caring, I would recommend him to everyone! ",1
4260,37223,1.0,"Dr. Watabe is the BEST! There is absolutely no comparison between him and my first OB. He is so caring and kind, and really listens to you. He was not even on call when I went into labor(As he had just returned from vacation the night before),and he came in to do my C-section. I don't know about you but I don't know to many doctors who would do that. I love him as a doctor. Actually the whole legacy office is GREAT. You won't find a better doctor! ",1
4261,37223,1.0,"Dr. Watabe is the best doctor I have ever been to!  I'm the type of person who gets VERY nervous about seeing doctors, but not with him.  Dr. Watabe genuinely cares about his patients.  He was very informative, yet left decisions up to me and my husband during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Dr. Watabe totally put me at ease.  Also, my husband came to every appointment with me during the pregnancy, and he thought Dr. Watabe was great too.  He always took the time to answer questions, including my husband's.  I have moved an hour away, but he's so good I'm considering going to him again when we decide to have another child...he's that good. ",1
4262,37223,1.0,"Love, love, LOVE this doctor and the whole office staff. For every urgent question I've had, a nurse calls me back within 15 minutes. For every non-urgent question, I still get a call back within an hour or two. They are very knowledgeable and considerate. Dr. Watabe is great. Calm and efficient. You're in, he answers your questions, and you're out. No wasting time (in a good way). The office is nice and clean. I even loved the u/s tech. I have been to other OB's that I liked, but no one compares. AND I'm pregnant with twins, and they've been more than helpful and able to deal with any issues :) ",1
4263,37223,1.0,"Dr. Watabe is hands down amazing!!! He is easy to talk to, and after having seen other doctors who couldn't explain (or didn't care to explain) my 2 miscarriages within one year, Dr. Watabe tested me, found the solution, and here I am, 8 months pregnant!!! I would reccomend him to anyone. He never makes you feel silly for asking questions and is a genuinely kind person. ",1
4264,37223,1.0,"YIKES.  I am the father of a patient this guy.  Three days ago my daughter was rushed to American Fork after her water broke at 3AM, she delivered 11 hours later at 2PM. Oh yeah, this is FIVE WEEKS EARLY.  This guy never showed up.  Never called.  Still hasn't called three days later.  So Beware fathers, husbands and ladies..... having a guy give you instructions and showing up during normal work hours at his office is good. And expected of ANYONE..... but NOT to be there in an emergency situation with 11 hours notice.....NOT TO SHOW UP.....for me as my daughters father... this is UNFORGIVABLE, UNPROFESSIONAL and UNCONSCIONABLE.  AND...Here we are three days later... no interest, no calls, nothing from his office to my daughter... she had to call his office to set up another appointment.  Why would he not even call her to see how she is doing.  My new granddaughter is in great hands at Primary Children's Hospital.  But my daughter still has to deal with &quot;the guy who didn't even call.&quot; ",-1
4265,37223,1.0,I love Dr. Watabe I have had 5 pregnancys in 6 years and so I have been through a few drs that dont compare.

4266,37223,1.0,"Wasn't my doctor, but he assisted in my emergency c-section and did my follow up visits in the hospital. He is VERY nice and genuinely cared about me. If Dr. Jones wasn't also fabulous I would switch doctors! But I get them both in the same practice. ",1
4267,37223,1.0,"I went to Dr. Watabe for the first time today and WOW!  What a breath of fresh air!  I had gone to a different Dr. about infertility and I can't believe the difference!  First of all the reception area was curteous, helpful, and quick.  Dr. Watabe took his time with me and listened and took notes and asked questions.  He put together a game plan and helped me understand it very well and really put my mind at ease.  He was very positive and reassuring.  I can't believe I had gone to a different Dr. , he was THAT good!  I HIGHLY recommend him!! ",1

4273,37223,1.0,"I saw him for my pregnancy and he always anwsered all of my questions and took so much time with me, and never made me feel rushed. The delivery went great. What a great doctor. He is actually at Legacy OBGYN now. ",1
4274,37223,1.0,"Dr. Watabe is one of the best Doctor's I've ever been to. And believe me, I've been to alot! My husband and I tried and tried for over a year to have a baby, and every other doctor ignored all of our questions/concerns and did not run one test! As soon as I went to Dr. Watabe, he did not waste any time and ran every test possible within 2 visits, had me take an Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test, and the very next month I became pregnant!!! He is wonderful and I recommend him to everyone. He listens to everything I have to say, and his calm, reassuring personality put me at ease. He the BEST!!! He has a HIGH fertility success rate because he's very thorough. I will only go to him now. So go see him!!! ",1
4275,37223,1.0,Dr Watabe never brushed off any of my pregnancy concerns or questions like my previous OB. He was very attentive and extremely knowledgable. I ended up having a c section and he was very calm and laid back about the whole thing and it helped keep us calm. I will go to him again and I strongly recommend him. ,1
4276,37223,1.0,"Dr. Watabe was a wonderful OB/GYN. He softened the anxieties that come with OB visits with his caring personality and went above and beyond his call of duty for my c-section. He helped to educate me on all options in regards to the birth of my baby, with the pros and cons to each choice, letting me make my own decisions. If I were to have another baby, I would definately choose to return to Dr. Watabe. ",1
4277,37223,1.0,Dr. Watabe is very focused on patient care and is very willing to answer questions and sit with you as long as you need. He works in a clinic with midwives and the doctors and midwives provide very complimentary care. He is also very gentle in his care. He is by far the best OB-GYN I have had and I would recommend him to anybody! He also does very well in fertility treatments and helping couples succeed. ,1
4278,37224,1.0,Dr. White and his staff are very kind and knowledgeable. Dr. White answers all my questions and I didn't feel rushed. His staff spent a long time getting a procedure approved for me and didn't seem put out about doing it. I would recommend Dr. White to my friends and family. ,1
4279,37225,0.0,"This doctor did not introduce himself or even look at me upon entering the exam room. He went immediately to the x-ray viewer and spent 5+ min. accusing me of wearing gold jewelry that ruined his x-ray - that is until he finally turned around to observe that in actuality his technician neglected to advise me to remove my zippered sweatshirt for the x-ray (so instead he began yelling at her down the hall). When I informed him that I had adult onset Type 1 diabetes, he insisted that only young kids can be diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and that I was surely uninformed about my chronic disease. When I expressed concerns about going under general anesthesia due to potential low blood sugar complications and asked him what precautions he might take, his response was &quot;we'll book you early in the morning.&quot; (I still have no idea what was meant by this remark). Despite the unprofessional experience, I have been unapologetically harassed by his staff to pay a consultation fee!! ",-1

4282,37226,1.0,"Dr. Weipert has a friendly and professional staff.  He is very knowledgeable and likeable.  You can tell he loves being a pediatric doctor.  I highly recommend him.  One thing that I thought was clever was when my kids needed shots for school.  He told them they needed shots but they had a choice of the little needle that hurts a little bit or the bit needle that hurts a lot.  After my kids said they wanted the little needle, he told the nurse to use the little needle.  The kids expected a little pain but feel better because they didn't have to get the big needle.  After the shots, Dr. Weipert's staff gave the kids words of encouragement along with a lolipop, stickers, and a toy. ",1

If they make a mistake they will not apologize they will fight with you instead. You must know all their rules and not ask any questions or you will get talked down to like you are stupid. The worst place I've ever been to! I went there for years and had many horrible experiences! It's a shame Dr Baker surrounds himself with such uncaring representatives.

4346,37427,1.0,"Doctor judges patients by their covers - profiles them based on appearance.  Does not allow time or take care to really hear them. When they bring up pain, dismisses them as drug seekers. Misdiagnoses critical diseases as minor ailments and prescribes OTC drugs.  Bad medicine.  ",-1
4347,37428,0.0,"She needs a new bedside manner!  Also, her reality that certain things do not cause pain is completely wrong.  All over the Internet it states that ovarian cysts and twisted cysts and tubes cause extreme pain but in her world if you complain of extreme pain you must be a drug user....

He did not do bloodwork on her, did not even take her temperature or xray her and then let her leave without a perscription  for an atibiotic. He told me even with elevated white count he wouldn't give her a perscription. He would treat her when she develops pneumonia. She is housed in the dorms and is working clinicals in the hospital.

4365,37476,1.0," Tremendous doctor! Knowledgable with terrific bedside manner. One of the best doctors of any kind I've seen (I'm 53 years old). Kind, patient, makes you feel like you matter.

Can't say enough good things about Dr. Gallagher and his support staff (friendly, helpful).  ",1
4366,37476,1.0," I have been a patient of Dr. Gallagher's for 15 years. I can't say enough good things about his knowledge, his ability to connect with his patients and his willingness to spend as much time as needed to answer questions and concerns.  I have never had a doctor of any kind be as compassionate and attentive.  He is simply the best! ",1
4367,37478,0.0," He is an idiot. I saw him in the ER and he sent me home and told me I had a UTI and that I was making a big deal out of it. I went back a few hours later because I was so sick. I had a bowel obstruction and needed emergency surgery. He also tried to send my 93 yr.old friend home from the ER, saying she just had a cold- the people that brought her, refused and called her dr. He admitted her- she was very sick and almost died.Thankfully she is doing well now.  ",-1
4368,37480,0.0," I found Dr. Golin and staff to be helpful, always available, knowledgable and deeply caring of their patients. It is very difficult dealing with patients in the psychiatric field; they're not always honest or capable of relating the truth to a doctor or anyone. Family members sometimes expect miracles and don't get them. Choosing a psychiatrist is a very personal relationship, not always between just a patient and a doctor. It includes family and sometimes other doctors. Psychiatrists are limited as to what information they are allowed to share with others involved in a patient's care. The doctor must work well with all members and that takes a unique soul. I have found that with Dr. Lorri Golin. I can see how another patient may not have. I have had difficulties with doctors in other practices, but in this area, I have found a kindred soul who listens to me, cares about me. She is deeply vested in my health and welfare. I highly recommend her services.  ",1
4369,37480,0.0," ABSOLUTELY DO NOT GO HERE. This woman hands out medications like skittles. Her inattention to detail nearly killed my mother. She put her on medications that are toxic when combined with medications she was already taking - AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I called to discuss, and they are rude, disrespectful, and unhelpful. Do not waste your time here. ",-1
4370,37489,1.0," The cost of care by Dr. Gage is definitely NOT worth your time, money, or the future problems resulting from poor quality work.  I had many crowns done with Dr. Gage.  He left too much space between my crowns when they were permanently cemented.  Now I deal with constant problems with food getting stuck inbetween my teeth, causing me to constantly have to floss.  I have been told by my current and awesome dentist that the excessive flossing will lead to bone errosion, not to mention the pain it causes trying to get the food out.  I felt trapped to go to Dr. Gage because he offered sedation only to be made fun of by him and the staff.  Patients tend to say things unknowingly while sedated.  I found out I don't NEED sedation now that I have found a quality dentist and care about his patients and will not do unnecessary work for the sake of a dollar.  Dr. Gage should be fully retired, not in partial retirement status. Paid/Co-pay:$10000",-1
4371,37489,1.0, Dr Gage advertises as an office for people with fear of the dentist but that is only the case if you are willing to be sedated. He is very impatient doesn't care one bit about his patient or their comfort. While he was doing a $600 filing he told me I would need a root canal.  With out giving me the option he did the filing anyway. One month later I couldn't stand the pain and called to schedule the root canal. I was told I had to come to the office first &quot;to make sure that is what I needed&quot;. Dr Gage was not willing to do the root canal so I was refered somewhere else and then charged $100 for the &quot;appointment&quot;. After already paying $600 for the filing I am now told that it will have to be replaced with a crown with-in a year. All of which is out of pocket because I don't have dental insurance. Paid/Co-pay:$1000,-1
4372,37489,1.0," Dr. Gage and his staff were wonderful.  I had a jaw infection that was very painful, which they saw me for and treated first.  Their care was excellent and my teeth have never been more healthy.  I am very pleased with this dentist, on many different levels. ",1
4373,37489,1.0," He is the worst, most uncaring dentist I have ever encountered. He gave me veneers but never told me there was acrylic in the cement even though I told him I was allergic to acrylic. A year later my mouth was burning up and he finally told me there was acrylic in the veneer cement. I then asked him to remove them. He wouldn't do it even though I was in SEVERE pain. I finally had to write to the manufacturer of the cement myself. They told me it was possible to have an allergic reaction to the cement. I put that in a complaint to the VT Dental Society. It was only then, a whole YEAR later, that he agreed to take the veneers off. But he ruined the crowns he put on by shaving away at the back of them. Then he put in a horrible set of metal crowns. ",-1
4374,37489,1.0," It seems like this office is concerned about getting your money.  They immediately want to schedule everything you need up front.  Will not accept insurance, you pay all up front, then the insurance reimburses you, so you pay full amount, no negotiations between insurance company and dentist.  Worst teeth cleaning I have ever had, did not remove any stains.  I think they perform work that may not have to be done.  We went a few times, but got tired of them calling and cancelling or wanting to reschedule our appointments.  We will not go back again.  Not happy in any way. ",-1
4375,37489,1.0," This is the best dentist I have ever been to.  The staff is extremely punctual, friendly, and attentive to your care.  Excellent atmosphere.  Knowledgeable about what they are doing. Well worth the extra money you might spend. Paid/Co-pay:$137",1

SINCE I COULD NOT AFFORD PORCELIN, THE DR SAID HE COULD DO LUMINEERS. HE REFUSED TO DO ONLY THE TWO FRONT TEETH, HE SAID HE WOULD ONLY DO THE SIX FRONT, WHEN I SAID NO I WOULD NOT DO THIS SINCE THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE OTHER TEETH HE AGREED TO DO FOUR. I WOKE UP TO FOUR TEETH THAT WERE CHIZZLED DOWN TO ALMOST NOTHING.  WHEN I ORIGINALLY ASKED ABOUT THIS PROCEDURE, I WAS TOLD THAT THE LUMINEERS FIT OVER MY OWN TEETH. IMAGINE FINDING OUT THAT THIS WAS NOT TOTALLY TRUE WHEN THE LUMINEERS FELL OFF..I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE LUMINEERS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER 2000.00 AFTER A YEAR TO REPLACE THEM WITH PORCELIN!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.. ",-1
4377,37489,1.0," Dr. Gage is awesome! He's so compassionate and understanding. He's very friendly. His staff is outstanding. You may pay a bit more for his services but he's totally worth it.

4381,37493,0.0," Dr Gelbstein has been my doctor for several years. She is very laid back but pays attention and has never been less than professional.

However, I had my first appointment in Ascutney and the nurse or medical assistant that asked me questions was completely rude, did not make eye contact, and never put on a smile on her face.

The complete disregard for the care and privacy of a patient is a complete disgrace. I am shocked by the complete disregard for the care of a patient.  I'm a Registered Nurse and am shocked such a doctor is allowed to treat patients ,-1
4394,37549,0.0," Very intelligent and insightful. She struck me as unusual among doctors because a) she seemed to actually enjoy her job, and b) she actually used her brain, rather than just mindlessly running tests and going through the motions. Although she is a specialist, she was better able to look at the big picture and than many GPs I have seen.

I had to leave and will definitely not be back.  To wait a month in pain and then never even get to see the doctor was very frustrating.

The staff at Dr. Olson's was actually quite the opposite. They were helpful, kind, made me feel comfortable, and seemed genuinely concerned.  Because of this it was very easy to notice and &quot;feel&quot; the striking contrast when Dr. Olson entered the room.  He was very invasive with personal questioning that was totally unnecessary. I go to the dentist to receive the best care available and be treated like any other patient with no judgements.  Don't expect that at Dr. Olson's Dentistry in Rutland, Vermont.

4446,37674,0.0,"I've been seeing Dr. Pinto for 10 years, and she is fantastic. She has an excellent bedside manner and seems to genuinely care about her patients. She's also very cheerful and has a way of putting people at ease. When I first started going to her, I noticed that she seemed much more efficient with a drill than other dentists - she gets that part done very quickly.  ",1

4453,37678,1.0,"I found this md rude and arrogant. He refused to listen to what I, the patient, reported. Assuming his own conclusions. I also heard him  discussing a patients medical condition in the waiting room for all to hear. Privacy&#63; And he was just as rude and demeaning with this patient as he was with me. No matter what his knowledge or education a good doctor listens to their patient. Potash is too full of himself to do this. I would never recommend this doctor to anyone, much less someone I cared about ",-1
4454,37678,1.0,This dr. is not knowledgeable!!  Had a horrible experience with him.  Find another GI!  Dr.  Potash was rude and talked down to me when I asked questions and didn't know the answer to my questions!  Go elsewhere! ,-1
4455,37678,1.0,I had met with him once to talk about the colonoscopy procedure.  I let him know that I had a phobia to needles. (I knew that I would need an IV for the procedure). I was very upset when he questioned the seriousness of my phobia. He made a dismissive comment to me.  I knew I would not be comfortable with this doctor.  ,-1
4456,37678,1.0,"This guy is great. Knows his stuff, smart as a whip. Excellent on follow-up. I went to see him for a colonoscopy. In the prep meeting, he grilled me about my anemia, challenging my answers to his questions. I didn't perceive it as insulting in any way. I could see that he was sifting through different possible causes and their implications. He's not artificially warm, but he's clearly competent. I get a kick out of the guy. Don't be scared by others' reviews - at the end of the day, you want someone who knows what they're doing. Potash does.  ",1
4457,37678,1.0,"I am a nurse in the ICU where Dr. Potash practices, and also happen to be married to one of his patients who has Crohn's disease. I'm disappointed to read so many unfavorable reviews.. I agree that Dr. Potash has a very ..uh, challenging demeanor. That is, he doesn't appreciate BS, including being late for appointments, not taking prescribed medication, etc. I will say, though, that he goes above and beyond for his patients. Dr. Potash is extremely knowledgeable and continues to learn and keep up on advancements in his field. He regularly consults with other experts in gastroenterology regarding treatments, medications, and plans of care. He may come off as being rude, but listen- the guy knows what he's doing. I send my wife to see him, and I trust that she is well-taken care of. Give me an a-hole that knows what he's doing over someone who will fluff over the rough stuff any day. I would give him 6 stars if I could, and I am very critical. He's an A+ doc. ",1

4459,37678,1.0,"I read the other comments and was so surprised.  Dr. Potash got me in to see him quickly due to concerning lab tests.  He ordered more tests to determine the problem that he suspected and was correct.  He referred me to Boston and called some people he knew there, getting me in quicker than I normally would have been able to.  After the procedure I had, he personally called my husband's cell phone to touch base.  Every time he says he will call me with results, he calls very quickly.  He has taken time to listen to both my husband and I and I am very grateful that he is my GI Dr.  ",1
4460,37678,1.0,This doctor nearly killed me by puncturing my abdomen during a routine endoscopy. His staff is great though. ,-1
4461,37678,1.0,"This  doctor is psychotic. I walked in his office 9 minutes past my appointment and he confronted me on that and you could tell he was pissed. He is rude talks down to you. After my colonoscopy he told me that everything was fine. two weeks later i get a call from the hospital in Keene(Dartmouth Hitchcock) that he had set up for me to go in and do a procedure where i was to swallow a camera. (He never set this up with me!)Few months later i bring this up with my primary care physician and asked him about doing the procedured. He called Potash , and he was told that he didn't remember doing that and i should call him(Obviously never did. Other people have had similar experiences.  Why is this man allowed to practice!!!I wouldn't bring my dog to him ",-1
4462,37678,1.0,"Never every again will I ever see or use this GI.Rude,demeaning,poor attitude to a patient that is sick.if you ask questions he tells you why are you asking him&#63; Like how dare you even question him!After 1st time seeing this Dr. never went back,went to a different GI in another state that a friend told me about in NH.It was like night & day with the 2 Doctors. Please do not use this GI for any reason at all.  Find someone else! ",-1
4463,37678,1.0,"This doctor is inconsistent in what he says, rude and nasty. When my husband was in the hospital with complications from chemotherapy and had fluid in his abdomen, Dr. Potash agreed with oncologist that fluid needed to be drained, then a day later called me at home saying that that would do no good, but he'd do it if we wanted. When I questioned him about this contradiction, he yelled at me, implied I was stupid and didn't understand. Also, my husband told me when Dr. P. saw him in his room in the hospital at this time, when he was very, very ill, Dr. P. was mean and nasty and told him he probably &quot;wouldn't make it&quot;, contrary to what the other docs were saying. Immediately after this (and by the way, he did drain the fluid from my husband's abdomen, and never told other docs it wasn't necessary;  he, in fact, recommended it) we both switched to another competent and kind gastroenterologist in another town. This doctor is cruel and sadistic.  Stay away from him! ",-1
4464,37678,1.0,"I would never recommend this GI.When you're so sick & didn't know you had a disease at 1st besides what you are feeling physically,& mentally your not thinking straight,because you are malnourished,& ill,he makes you feel you are stupid,not-educated,treats you like your a kid in grammer school meeting with the principle.Scolds you,has even said &quot;it's all in your head&quot; when the disease was dignosed correctly though barium test & colonoscopy's.He has missed on a couple of occasions that the disease was prevalant again. Painful colonoscopys & rectal exam's he doesn't care!When you have him as a Dr. he has a God symdrome like attitude,which I call him a Jeckle & Hyde personality. Find someone else like I did,dealt w/him for to long before I found a new DR. that is so much better,more caring,more knowledgeable.  I would never go back to this GI if he was the only GI left on earth! Period!! ",-1
4465,37678,1.0,"I've never felt so uncomfortable with any doctor in my life. His manner is very inappropriate,  flirtatious and demeaning as well as terribly arrogant. By the time I left his office, I felt violated. I wanted to go home and take a bath.  I've since spoken to other patients of his who had exactly the same reaction to him. he's a very creepy guy. He was of no help whatsoever, by the way.  ",-1

4467,37680,0.0,"My son has been in a lot since birth, and every time we are told something different. None of their suggestions work, and no follow up is ever provided. Most recently was told to switch to formula (we breastfeed exclusively) rather than actually addressing the problem at hand, which was not related to feeding at all. Were also pressured about vaccinations when we made it clear we wanted to delay vaccinating. In addition, we brought son in with an infection and were sent home. We ended up in the ER less than a day later.  My son has a unisex name, and the nurses and doctors ask every time how &quot;she&quot; is, even after we explained that we have a baby boy (and even when he is wearing blue)! ",-1
4468,37691,1.0, Wonderful MD. I brought my elderly Mom here &amp; he was patient &amp; kind. He did not try to get her into surgery but tried very conservative measures first even though she has wonderful insurance coverage.  Impressed ,1
4469,37691,1.0," Dr. Rinaldi is the best podiatrist that I've ever gone to.  I have feet issues.  Many feet issues; and I've seen several different podiatrists -now, I wouldn't go to anyone else besides Dr. Rinaldi regarding my feet.  I was thrilled with his service when he practiced in CT then, when I discovered that he moved his practice to Vermont, where I've been living since 1990, I was overjoyed and continue to entrust my feet to Dr. Rinaldi.  I've been feeling so good, I've started running and will be asking for Dr. Rinaldi's professional advice.  ",1
4470,37691,1.0," I have first class insurance and this visit was billed at top rates. Dr Rinaldi hurried, brusque, I'd say bordering on rude. A waste of time and not ultimately helpful at all. Paid/Co-pay:$100",-1
4471,37691,1.0," The Sports Medicine Clinic in Sharon Vermont is, no doubt, a first class facility. The staff seems competent but decidedly interested in re-directing patients back to the home based hospital nearby and scheduling as many tests as possible, regardless of any relevance to Podiatry, Orthopedics or indeed &quot;Sports Medicine&quot;. The clinic itself is a wonder. The X-Ray machine alone, taking up a good size room to itself, will resolve details way beyond the skill of the Doctor to interpret. The prima donna, Dr. Rinaldi (who will ask you to call him Bob) is actually impatient, rushed and a bad listener. He, and the clinic, are not good providers but perfect examples of the American medical crisis. Immense amounts of resources flow to the health care industry, pharmaceuticals, insurance companies at everyone else's expense. Even if you're an athlete, try not to be seduced by the name &quot;Sports Medicine&quot; and find  clinic or doctor not oriented towards pure profit. ",-1

4478,37722,2.0," Sought treatment for a clear cut case of the flu. My roommate was just getting over the flu when I cam down with the same symptoms. The doctor refused to give me tamiflu because I did not have a fever. I had been taking Ibuprofen all day to keep my fever down, but had cough, vomiting and all other symptoms. I sought treatment within the 48 hour time frame.  Noticed the sign in the office gave a list of flu symptoms with an * by fever stating that not all patients have a fever. Very disappointed in the care. Standard of care not what I would expect. ",-1

(He found me a doctor for my son at college.) He always gives me good advice and is up on recommendations for prostate cancer screening (my father had prostate cancer).  This practice has always seemed to be really high quality.  Sometimes they get behind because they are busy, but I don't mind waiting my turn.  ",1

4487,37779,1.0,Doctor was very educated on my issues and took x-rays that showed my exact problem. It was amazing that he found things that have never been told to me before. I was shocked how much time he spent with me reviewing my x-rays and detailing the process. I have been struggling with neck and arm pain for years and never thought to seek a Chiropractor until my MD suggested I give it a try. I have gone 3 times now and feel better than I have in 20 years. The environment is very friendly and clean. They make you feel a part of a family and they really care about your health.

Volansky referred me to an OT, ended our conversation with, &quot;We won't need to see each other again for this issue.&quot; Six weeks of Hand therapist soaking insurance company &amp; me for two thousand but didn't address shoulder pain or hand swelling/pain. On line research said prednisone used to treat carpal tunnel. I take Hydrocortisone for pituitary insufficiency, so self-medicated for CTS. Pain/swelling gone in two days.

The day she did mine, she was so sick that three of us asked to reschedule and she said no she was okay to do it. She makes it sound like the operation is easy and a quick 15-20 min.procedure. It is WAY more then what she leads you to believe! She isn't a caring person at all and doesn't help you at all when she messes up. I found out she has messed up on others too and ships them off to physical theraphy like she did to me. But there is no hope with it and your left in a life time of chronic pain.

My whole family are patients at kiaser and have been quick to share my thoughts with them as well.  I was disappointed in the visit with her. She was very unprofessional and not caring at all. These are two of the few things I felt wrong about the visit. Very few questions were asked about my problem.  I was just referred to another doctor which I am thankful for.

4532,37822,1.0,not an honest dentist.  I was told i needed work I know i did not need !! I was ripped off and it is impossible to get your money back !!! He should seriously be investigated ! do not waste your time or your MONEY !!!!!!! ,-1
4533,37822,1.0,"bedside manner could use an overhaul. He never said hello or introduced himself. Seemed to be preoccupied with other things, he sat down said open up and lets get to work. barely said 2 words to me then after it was done said I needed alot of work done. no way will I go back. His assistant Reggie was more friendly and calming then he was. Look elsewhere! ",-1
4534,37822,1.0,Unprofessional on SO many levels. Horrible patient skills. Arms/hands leaning on my face. Water draining down my face and neck. Stained a shirt. Assistants do not care anymore than he does. Had to leave once due to waiting almost an hour for my set appointment. Deceptive business practices. Overcharged and then attempted to bill even more. I strongly urge you to look somewhere else. STRONGLY urge you ! ,-1

4536,37823,1.0,"Dr. Damian Banaszak has a terrible bedside manner, does not listen to the patients. He is rude and treats the patient like a hassle. During my examination in the ER, he walked out of the exam room and slammed the door behind him while I was in mid sentence explaining my medical history. This man is a horrible doctor and cares more about the papers he's going to write about different medical subjects then he does about the patient. First words out of his mouth, when I met him, was that he was planning to write a paper about the very problem I was in the ER for, yet he had no interest in listening to anything I had to say. He degraded me by telling me to my face that &quot;THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ROOM, WHAT YOU HAVE IS NOT AN EMERGENCY!&quot; I'm sorry, but chest pain with pain shooting down the left arm certainly felt like and emergency to me. I was made to feel like an intruder into his domain yet I'm certain he charged my Insurance anyway. Stay Awar from Dr. Damian Banaszak.  ",-1
4537,37824,0.0,"Dr. Mana Badipour is the best dentist I have ever been to.  She is friendly, professional, always on time and most of all, honest.  I trust everything she says and never feel as though she is making recommendations simply to get money out of me.  I also like the promptness of my appointments.  Dr. Mana Badipour has never been late and I am always in and out within 30 minutes.  I would highly recommend her.  ",1

4539,37826,1.0,"The doctor came in took one look at the mole in question and said lets take it off. It took about 45 seconds and he cauterized the wound.  No stitches to the quarter size wound. No follow up instructions.  After 2 1/2 weeks it is still a gaping wound and will take weeks to heal and will leave a huge puckered scar. I felt like he just couldn't take the extra few minutes to put a couple of stitches in it.  He hardly took the time to even look me in the face when he talked, which was minimal.  Horrible bed side manner and I have no idea how this guy could be voted one of the best.  ",-1
4540,37826,1.0,"The wait time was inordinate - first in the outer waiting room and then even longer in the exam room.  Considering I have had 2 previous melanoma surgeries, the initial exam was very cursory - done by his assistant, not Dr. Bajoghli.  It was hard to get his attention - he had music playing on his IPhone wherever he went.  He never discussed my history with me.  He called me &quot;darling&quot; instead of learning my name. He did perform MOHS surgery on an area that I pointed out after lab results determined that it was a basal cell cancer.  The surgical results seem sufficient but my overall experience was less than satisfactory.  ",-1

4545,37826,1.0,"My son had a severe rash and an enlarged lymph node the size of half a walnut on his neck. Dr Bajoghli misdiagnosed...Gave him steroid cream for the severe itching. My son was diagonosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma after 2 trips to Potomac's ER. My son went through 8 months of chemo and is now cancer free. I feel Dr. Bajoghli was rushed and is more concerned with cosmetic treatments and surgery than dermatology. I guess that's where he makes his money! He may be a good Dr. for cosmetic purposes but I feel he isn't for dermatology!! After my son was diagnosed, I got online and Hodgkin's patients sometimes do have an exceptionally itchy rash as well as  swollen lymph nodes. I was surprised he didn't know that! ",-1
4546,37826,1.0,Great doctor with wonderful bedside manners.  Referred by my coworker and he has treated several people at work for skin cancers.  Both of my parents were referred to him by their skin doctor for MOHS treatment of basal cell cancers. ,1
4547,37826,1.0,"The wait time can be unusally long.  I have sat there so long, I had to reschedule.  When I had a biopsy with the nurse practitioner, I was never notified.  I had to call and ask for the results three times.  The first two times, my phone calls were never returned.  After one month, and the third call, I finally received the results of a precanerous condition.

4550,37827,0.0,"Just came back from my and my husand's first(&last;) visit. Today, Sep 09 2011, as you know we've been having heavy rainstorms with a lot of road closure - but we did leave early, had to take a long way around, and called them to notify that we could be a few minutes late due to these conditions. They never said anything on the phone but to come on in, so we kept on driving, and arrived 10 minutes late.  AFTER filling all the forms, they told us that the doctor won't see us because we were late. WE CALLED TO LET THEM KNOW! If they had said on the phone, that we should reschedule we wouldn't have been this upset. This means that they didn't care to remember that we were the people who called that we would be late. And this is what they are like on our FIRST VISIT where they should make a good first impression&#63; Don't know about dr's skills(duh, never got to see her) but staff are very rude and unprofessional. WE AREN'T GOING BACK AND NOT RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.  ",-1
4551,37827,0.0,"The service levels at this practice have been going downhill steadily. The whole office seems to be set up to avoid communication with the patient (customer). Callbacks are requested but when you call, the front desk puts you into a voice mail. If you call during lunch, you can't leave a message.  Had to wait at the pharmacy 1 1/2 hours while the pharmacist (!) called to confirm my Rx. Also, tendency is to order extensive (and expense) labs for routine exam of healthy young adult - but then you can't get the lab results because of the voice mail game. Have hung on for a few years, but have had it. Not returning, and don't recommend you go there. ",-1
4552,37827,0.0,"It's impossible to speak to anyone who can help. And, they won't discuss test results over the phone, but it's impossible to get an appointment because their hours are so restrictive! I went in with a fever and a swollen lymph node, and Dr. Bae ignored those symptoms and decided I must be pregnant - she completely ignored my fever and swollen lymph node. Then, she sent me for a pregnancy test and they sent me on my way without figuring out my lyphe node/fever problem - when I called back later to ask about what I should do about it, Dr. Bae told me that I'm not pregnant. NO SH*#! Hello, what about my fever and swollen node&#63; She doesn't listen, doesn't take time to do a good exam, and the office staff is less than helpful. Don't go there.  ",-1
4553,37827,0.0,"I too am baffled by the negative comments. I have been a patient of Dr. Bae for 9 years and have never experienced any of the problems listed in previous posts. I was battling the flu last week and was able to get a same day appointment. She diagnosed bronchitis and an ear infection and put me on antibiotics right away. I don't have any chronic conditions so I generally only see her once or twice a year, but she has been very agressive in my husband's multiple conditions, scheduling follow ups every 3-4 months to ensure he is on track. We specifically kept our insurance to stay with Dr. Bae even though my company raised the rates this year.  ",1
4554,37827,0.0,"I have been a patient for many years and in that time with Dr. Bae's help I have gone from 280 lbs. to 220 lbs. and am able to manage my Type II diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol so well that she has taken me off of all diabetes meds and reduced the others.  I read the negative comments here and I just don't get it.  If you listen to her and actually take it to heart and are consistent then its absolutely clear that Dr. Bae and her practice are top notch.  She listens and provides a plan for wellness.  Also, its not hard to get an appointment.  She's so good that now my wife is a patient of hers.  I highly recommend her.  ",1
4555,37827,0.0,"Not really impressed with Dr. Bae. Yes, she is friendly, but has not been helpful to me with my health concerns. She does not take my concerns seriously and it is hard to get real medical help from her. (For something like a cold or a twisted ankle, sure, but not for actual health problems.) Also, nearly impossible to get a same-day appointment - and the staff is impossible to reach as well without leaving a voicemail and waiting hours to be called back. Needless to say, I am looking for another doctor.  ",-1

4558,37827,0.0,"I've always found her to use a great combination of common sense and medicine.  I had high cholesterol, and she had me work out and eat better before considerig meds.  The cholesterol came down without the need for pills!  She has also taken a non-alarmist approach to other issues I've had.  She isn't one of those docs who just whips out the prescription pad.  She seems to take a broad approach to what ails you and what will make you feel better.  ",1
4559,37827,0.0,"I think Dr Bae is wonderful. I have been with her for several years. I also live in Rockville and travel to Falls Church for appointments. I recognize that other people have had negative experiences, but this is not the norm. I highly recommend her practice.  ",1

I left a message at 8AM and didn't hear back so I tried again at 2PM and was told she wasn't feeling well and I wasn't going to get a call back and when I said I would report her and got upset I got a call back from the office manager and he repeatedly asked about the nature of my procedure even though I told him it was private matter. He told me this is a doctors office and I could tell any of them. It was so rude. At the end of the day I had still not heard back from Dr. Bae. I had to contact my old family physician from my hometown to get my questions answered. I have never seen such a lack of respect for privacy or treated so rudly. We have pulled our files from her office and will not go back. I would definitely not recommend this practice. Dr. Bae could care less about her patients and the pratice is unorganized.  ",-1
4562,37827,0.0,"I was in her office one day with flu symptoms, high fever and ear ache. She sends me home with over the counter medications saying it was just the flu.  Two days later I am in the emergency room with an eardrum about to pop ",-1
4563,37827,0.0,I agree with another comment left on this site.  I think she was condescending.  She used herself as an example while providing me with some suggestions.  Which I think was horrible comparing apples and oranges.  Also could not provide with me with a needed prescription considering my current situation.  She seems like a very nice person but needs to separate herself when making suggestions.  ,-1

4567,37827,0.0,"Dr. Bae is very understanding and personable. She explains any ailment that I come in with and answers all of my questions. I did not feel rushed in her office and had all of my concerns addressed. I too am a medical professional and disagree with the other person's comments. It sounds like insecurity to me if you have to judge a doctor and nurse's techniques because you feel you are superior.

I'm a medical professional myself, and although I'm young, I feel I deserve to be spoken to as the professional that I am. She doesn't listen to me, and she's quick to just schedule another appointment and keep collecting my copay instead of addressing all of the issues in one visit; very inefficient. I didn't really care for her nurses either; when she took my blood pressure, I had to teach her how to do it properly. That's less then impressive.  ",-1
4571,37827,0.0,Fantastic and friendly. She takes the time to LISTEN and gets to know you.  ,1
4572,37827,0.0,"Best doctor I've ever been to. She's helpful and knows what she's talking about, and is willing to joke around and put you at ease. The wait is about 10 minutes after arrival. She has really caring nurses, too. Prescribes generics and gives free samples to keep medicine costs down. Not overly crowded, I can get an appointment for the next day or the day after. I've never had a doctor as good as her and I'd never go elsewhere unless I moved. I absolutely adore her as a doctor, I've never felt uncomfortable and don't even have enough time to get bored while waiting. I’ve been going to her for about 3 years and see her maybe 4 times a year.  ",1
4573,37828,1.0,"Always very friendly.  At one time I found Dr. Bakhshi and his practice helpful.  In the past few years, however, it seems as if I have to schedule multiple appointments in order to make progress or diagnose what is wrong.  Often I am left with the impression that Dr. Bakhshi sees so many patients daily, that he cannot make a proper diagnoses due to his haste.  He has good advice from time to time, but relies on overmedication instead of root cause identification.  Hopefully Dr. Bakhshi will see what he is doing for what it is - and correct it.  ",-1

He's always willing to listen &amp; even try new things I've studied about (I'm very active in my care).  He promised not to give up on trying to find relief for me - and he didn't (I have been a complex case with numerous problems).  Best doctor I've ever seen - bar none.  I think too many people just want someone to listen (or to tell what to do) instead of realizing that this doctor, at least, knows more than you &amp; doesn't need to listen much to know what to do.  The proof is in the results - not how much one's back is patted. And the results may take more than one &quot;miracle&quot; visit, many give up on pain mgmt. after 1 or 2 visits.  In 6 yrs of near monthly visits I've only waited more than 15 or 20 mins. on 2 occasions. I would, and have, recommended him above anyone else for pain mgmt.

Threatened to refuse treatment to me, along with the R.N. on duty, because I refused to step on the scale (this was for a skin rash that had nothing to do with weight). I am a healthy, normal weight female. Made me cry and have a panic attack by giving me an ultimatum - &quot;step on the scale and give me your weight or leave the office,&quot; essentially. I have never encountered such gross unprofessionalism or rudeness. Not to mention he was putting the health and safety of myself, a patient, in danger by refusing treatment. Sobbing, I asked for another doctor, but the woman at the front desk refused to switch me to another until the next day. At this point, hives had enveloped my entire body so I was forced to submit to Dr. Banks' wishes. He then spent a good 30 seconds assessing my situation and left abruptly.

Third visit for extreme thirst, using the bathroom and weight loss.  All three visits were within a 3 month period.  At the third visit, I asked for a blood sugar test.  He said it would be a &quot;waste of time.&quot;  He said to come back when she was feeling better to get a fasting test.  He said there was no way she had Daibetes.

Every time that I call, we are immediately able to be seen by one of the doctors in the practice. The doctors and nurses have called me back regaarding any questions that I have had, once they even called me in Hawaii to give me good news on test results. All of the doctors in this practice are very knowledgeable and professional. Regarding Dr. Banta being loud, that is just her. She is a &quot;loud talker.&quot; Some may perceive that as rude, but she is not that way at all. I have felt very pleased with this practice. We are probably in almost every three weeks since my son's immune system is somewhat comprimised due to his being born premature.  Highly recommend this practice over others! ",1

Banta, not only was she rude and disrespectful but was rough with my son and also raised her voice at him when clearly he is only 2 and thought he was getting a shot and not just a check up, common sense for an adult but not a child. And my phone call was not returned from her to resolve this issue. Personal problems should be left at home and not taken out on the patients or there parents. Very disspleased with Dr. Banta. ",-1

Never once did they appologize. They often had to be reminded of previous treatments and tried more than once to give my daughter the same innoculation.  Always in a rush to get to the next patient, they obviously overschedule trying to get as mony patients through the system as fast as possible.  Seemed far more intereseted in making money than caring for children. The only reason we stayed as long as we did was my wife wanted to have the same doctor for the first year, and that was a big mistake.  ",-1

This is unlike many other doctors who push so they can gain money on new procedures.

Seen her 3 times I think and a nerve Doctor 1 time that stuck pins in my right leg lol. She had to turn up the equipment all the way for one nerve to react and told me all is well just keep going to physical therapy. Oh and read the back to all new patients’ for a referral to physical therapy  as when I went there it has a disclosure that states something about the physical therapy is owned by her or she has a interest in it lol.

When I do get to see her, she says the staff never notified her of my call. Dr. Barr seems to have become impatient with me and is sometimes rude.  I guess we're both feeling stuck.  I don't blame her for my situation, I just want some relief.  ",1

Come on now ..is that good medicine&#63;&#63; I think not..and I did refuse those.

He said oh the Prolo treatments will not help this problem you are having now, and you need PT to help this. Dr. Barr has been out of town for 3 weeks so I can't get her opinion. How is Michael (who is not an MD) qualified to make diagnosis and prescribed treatment&#63; Willing to hang in here alittle while longer.

In a week, the second two crowns were perfect. I am very impressed because my last dentist would have taken much more time to get the work done and I usually had to go back for &quot;tweeking.&quot;  Dr. Banker's  staff has always been pleasant and very helpful.

4723,37875,1.0,HORRIBLE! I cancelled the appointment before it started. The staff is rude and not smart. I moved so I needed a new dentist. I scheduled the appointment and should've known then that they were horrible. The staff couldn't tell me if they accepted my type of Anthem insurance. (My insurance company said yes.) They didn't tell me to bring anything for the appointment. I arrived and they were going to do x-rays. I asked if my insurance would cover it. They told me it wasn't their responsibility to see if my insurance would cover it. They got irritated that I didn't know the last time I had x-rays. They told me they would have to check with Dr. Banker to see if he could even do the cleaning part of the appointment without x-rays. They suggested I have my old dentist send them and then come back so Dr. Banker could look at them.  Like I was going to come back. I wish I checked this site beforehand.  Stay away! ,-1

About a month ago, however, I went to see Dr. Banker because I thought I had something stuck in my teeth.  Dr. Banker was extremely rude and impatient with me.  He was having trouble seeing what I was referring to in my tooth, so he got very frustrated and started yelling at me, saying, &quot;What is the problem&#63; I can't feel your inside your mouth the way you can so you have to tell me!&quot;  Then he took a sanding tool and started sanding my tooth, without telling me why or what he was doing.  He then said, &quot;Is it better&#63;&quot;  When I hesitated in my answer because now my tooth simply felt different, he snapped, &quot;Well, it's a yes or no question!

From reading the other reviews, the only thing that I can say about those comments are that most people will only leave a comment if they are unhappy, not when they are satisfied.  He is very current on the latest studies and if I come to him for a question, he always can recite which study I am talking about and give his comments/opinions.  I have recommended my Mom who also now sees Dr. Banzon and have told my 18 year old to also go to him.  After 12 years of being a patient, I have never, ever had a problem with his advice or diagnoses.

He told her she could wait until next day to see cardiologist and set up the appointment for her. Before sunup next morning she was rushed to hospital emergency room with another full-blown attack and nearly died there. She now is barely alive with only one artery barely functional.

After serveral visits (all follow up charged for of course) he told me to ask for a second opinion. This kind of doctor can only practice because the country has fewer MD's than it needs. We need more doctors so the competition will weed out people like Ball.  ",-1

I have also undergone surgery for both the bladder and recently for my prostate.  I feel lucky that Dr Ball is my doctor.  Many patients complain that the office backs up.  What they don't realize is that there are a lot of emergencies that the doctors and nurses have to handle.  Be patient.  If you want the best, you sometimes have to wait.  ",1

The nurse told him several times I was in the waiting room, and yet he kept on blabbing cheerfully to another patient.   Barbano kept me waiting for more than an hour and when he finally saw me, he refused to give me anything for the pain.  I should have gone to the emergency room!  Finally, he is unkempt -- he had mud on shoes which was a total gross out.  ",-1
4783,37893,1.0,"Dr. Barbano is excellent. He is very caring and attentive to his patients. There is never really any wait time and he is able to squeeze you in for last minute appts. The first time I saw him was for an emergency appt as a new patient, he was the only doctor willing to see me. He always remembers my medical history and my name when I go to see him even before he looks at my chart. He listens to any and all questions/new problems I may have and advises on each of them without hesitation. He has his own private practice which is small. The staff at times can be off putting but seem to be getting better. They call with test results in a timely matter. I've called for advice many times and a nurse is always available to answer questions, many times the Dr. himself will return my call and answer my questions which is great.  I would recommend Dr.Barbano to all.  ",1
4784,37893,1.0,"Dr Barbano has provided sincere and thorough medical advice and care over the years he has been my primary doctor.  He listens to questions with interest which is not as common as it used to be in the medical community.  The practice has grown since I first began seeing Dr Barbano and wait times for appointments have increased somewhat though the office does try to fit sick patients in the same day if possible.  The staff has changed from a more personal style which I prefer to a more formal way of speaking to patients, but that can happen as a practice adds patients.  Staff members have always been courteous and helpful in my experience.  ",1

4786,37893,1.0,"Dr. Barbano is very knowledgeable and extremely thorough (sometimes too much so--I do get nagged a bit but I need it!) I have been seeing him for high blood pressure issues mostly but he has also helped me with other more minor things and is always interested in my entire well-being. He is thoughtful, caring and does not mind spending time to answer questions. I have found his staff very helpful. I just wish there was someone there who could get a &quot;hard stick&quot; when it comes to drawing blood. I always have to go to an outside lab for blood work.  ",1
4787,37893,1.0,"We have been going to Dr. Barbano for three months and have seen him several times for a variety of issues. He's very knowledgable and thorough. He's willing to squeeze us in on short notice. When we are squeezed in, sometimes we have to wait but we don't mind at all. To our surprise, we have also enjoyed working with all of his referring physicians. His office staff is very competant and friendly. And unlike our previous family physician, he is willing to address all the issues we bring to his office. Our last physician would only speak to us about one issue per appointment. His office also accepts several different kind of insurance, which many offices are narrowing down. My backround is in nursing and I'm a picky patient. We will stick with this office.  ",1
4788,37893,1.0,When he is unavailable there is often no backup. Office often does not return calls. Front desk not very polite or patient service oriented.

I have wanted to get the custom mouth guard and my 5 year old's front tooth fixed but Dr. Banaji has made several goods points about it being unnecessary and a waste of money at this point in my children's development.  I am always asked if I want a service - x-ray, panoramic x-ray before the service is performed.  Every procedure is explained to me.

In addition, he never remembers why you are there nor will he take the time to read your folder.  When I reminded him of the reason, he tried to speak over me and told me I didn't have a problem and that every other doctor for the last 10 years had misdiagnosed me.

The receptionist should have told me that on the phone.

4819,37899,1.0,"This physician dropped the ball with post surgical care.  The doctor and his staff kept referring the patient to the paperwork that they handed out pre-operatively, and refused requests to be seen by the doctor.  Patient was told that the doctor only sees patients 14 days after surgery and not before.  This included a request to be seen following an ER visit/hospital admission due to complications.  Nurses at the hospital were shocked that the doctor refused to see his patient upon release from the hospital.  Totally unacceptable care.

I moved further away from her office about an hour but I would drive ANY amount for her . I could NEVER have imagined any one else could have given me the wonderful birthing experiences I had all 3 times :-)  I not only consider her my very knowledgeable obgyn but I consider her a friend who shared in 3 of the greatest moments of my life and I thank her for always keeping us safe and worry free .

When I called her office as a first time patient, I had one of the most rude phone conversations ever.  The staff sighed with irritation after I told her I was a first time patient.  She clearly sent me a signal that she did not want to deal with this and she was annoyed. I am a generally patient person, but I ended the call after she asked me questions in a very disrespectful manner. I looked the reviews and info again to make sure that I was not calling a wrong office. I was not.  As much as I like to try Dr. Bannon, I decided that I didn't want to experience this again.

Sometimes just knowing that your doctor is really listening to your level of pain goes a long way in pain management.

He is able to listen and understand you and impart information to you.  He is unfortunately only at the Alexandria CSB, which is the City Mental Health Clinic, and they have rigid requirements that require you also have a case manager, which I did not need (mostly so govt workers can keep their jobs) to become a client/patient. I had been a patient of his for ten years, until they recently decided to change to this plan. Dr. Barbot is always respectable and kind.

Both for my surgeries and for my after-surgery visits for checkups, they nearly always got me in (either for surgery preparation or to see the Doctor) way before my appointment time if I got there earlier than the appointment times.  I felt from beginning to end that all staff working with me did a great job, (not a small feat for a patient who has never had surgery and was terrified of going through it at the beginning!)

He will explain your prescription and will talk to you at great length about what you need to know.

I made the mistake (several years ago) of going to a different optometrist back when I was away at college.  The difference between these two is light and day.  Dr. Figler will spend a lot of time examining your eyes and making sure your eyes are healthy--the other optometrist had rushed me and had me out in 10 minutes.

His practice now is very dissapointing and the staff is nothing but rude. Their customer service is the worst! It's too bad because Dr. Farrell was highly recommanded and I thought he was an excellent doctor. I'm sure he doesnt realize how far his practice has gone down hill.

4897,37921,1.0,"This now a substandard practice, which is unfortunate because when Dr. Farrell's father ran it, it was great. It has now become nothing more than a business where you and your children are treated as customers as opposed to patients. The &quot;triage&quot; done by the nurse (not the doctor) is nothing short of a joke. And if you discuss the issues with the doctors they will simply refer you to the office manager. It felt like the doctors have no desire to take responsibility for THEIR practice, and in turn treatment and patients (or as they see you - customers) suffer. Whose practice is it - the doctor's or the office manager's&#63; The doctors seem unwilling to take any responsibility for what is going on, and I think that is why it is a revolving door for docs - anybody who is skilled and dedicated will be unlikely to stay. I used to love them, now I left, but they just don't seem to listen to the concerns of patients. I guess that is what they pay an office manager for.  ",-1

The up front staff is nice, this review is in no way reflective of them. I have to change OB/GYN's now because I am terrified of this woman delivering my child because she seems to never have the correct information on me. I have been sent to high risk specialists and she never has the charts available and never tells the nurse what's going on so they ask me duplicate questions and act like I am not telling the truth when they neglected to get the proper notification.

When my routine exams called for further testing, she always put my health first and that in itself speaks a ton--compared with other OB/GYNs I had in the past.

There were no medical reasons for either, but he believes that, in his words, &quot;there's nothing natural about natural births&quot; because they wreak havoc on the mother. He mocked any questions I asked about delivery. Example: after taking a Lamaze class I asked whether it could help to walk around the hospital room after labor started and he said &quot;did you take a lamaze class&#63; People who take classes always ask dumb questions&quot; His daughter also has a condescending style. Both seemed like they hadn't opened a medical book in 20 yrs,since much of what they said contradicted the current medical lit/other doctors. A couple positive things: he conducted an amnio for me w/o any problems, and he was complimented by other docs for how well he circumcised my son.

I wanted to try for a VBAC again if my health and my baby's health allowed; Dr. F was agreeable - until I got to about week 30.  Then he pressed hard to schedule a c-section.  He told me that babies are - by definition - better off outside the womb than in after week 36.  When I asked if my or my baby's health suggested specifically that she needed an early delivery he said no.  He repeated that as a rule ALL babies are better off outside than in after week 36.  He also told me my final ultrasound results were &quot;very worrying&quot; because my baby was measuring at the 10th percentile (I'm a slight 5 footer), and then revealed he hadn't actually looked at the ultrasound. In fact according to the report my baby had all very positive indicators, she was just small. That was the final straw. I switched OBs at 37 wks. I had a successful VBAC. ",-1

The hospital staff told me that I had the best surgeon and the one they would choose for themselves. They were very respectful of him and deferred to him in all matters. My daughter is his patient also.  She feels the same way.  He is extremely professional and caring. He is attentive to questions and allows as much time as needed for them.

I do like wine on occasion. He doesn't agree. Oh well. As long as he doesn't lecture me. Guess I'm too lazy to change doctors. I have new insurance &quot;Guardian&quot;.

He gave me IV antibiotics and I decided to spend the night in the hospital. The next morning I was fine and left the hospital with no explanation of what had happened. Last but not least, in one of the previous checkups he told me that my vaginal lips were very large and that he could remove them. I find it very unprofessional to tell this to a pregnant woman.

First he mocked the disease, saying it did not exist, then he mocked the medication I take for it, then he mocked me for &quot;falling for&quot; believing that I had it.  I felt angry, humiliated, and just stunned that a doctor would mock a patient with a painful ... and very real ... disorder.  His entire attitude was rude and dismissive and I couldn't wait to get out of there.  ",-1

4926,37930,1.0,"I stayed with Dr. Filipescu for most of my 3rd pregnancy. But became concerned when he pushed strongly for me to induce or have a c-section as early as 37 weeks.  There was no medical reason for me to have my baby early.  It seemed to be driven by a philosophical stance that all babies are in grave danger and intervention should be the first resort.  I'm inquisitive and asked questions (but still we didn't spend more than 30 minutes talking together over the last 3 weeks of my choosing him as a doctor).  He was clearly often irritated and insulting about my questioning him about why he was giving me the advice he was giving.  Ultimately I decided that although I trusted him in a medical crisis, I didn't want to work with him during what has been a safe and healthy pregnancy as his approach is to treat me as if I'm reckless if I don't deliver the baby early.

He found a lump in my breast and was aggressive in checking it out (turned out to be nothing).  He is supportive in my choice to be childless -- he doesn't agree, but supports it and helps me make educated decisions regarding this choice.  The staff can be rude especially over the phone -- e.g. several years ago, when I needed IMMEDIATE treatment for a yeast infection after a long weekend of agony.  But Dr. DiPaulo (Dr. F was out of town) did fit me in and take care of it.  I find Dr. F is not judgmental and will listen to my choices -- but he's rail thin and always pushes to have you lose weight -- &quot;big salads&quot;.  He does notice when my weight is down tho and I think he is motivated by my overall health.  I RECOMMEND his to my friends.  ",1
4929,37930,1.0,"I think 'stern' is too nice for Dr. Filipescu.  He is insensitive to women's health and needs. No doctor should tell a pregnant woman in her most sensitive state that she is 'fat' EVERY single time he sees her....that is what I experienced.  It sounds like I was not the only recipient.  Dr. F is old school and needs to update his medical knowledge.  His response to my complains about not being to breath due to allergies was to stuff something in my nose-all day even during work. If you want a doctor who respects you and listens to you and actually tries to help you with real medical solutions during your pregnancy, this is definitely NOT the doctor for you.  I agree with one reviewer, run as fast as you can to another practice...there are plenty of good ones out there.  I am so glad I left mid pregancy and found caring, professional doctors somewhere else.  This office also had a very high turnover rate. Seems the staff don't want to stay either...ergo the unprofessional staff remains.  ",-1
4930,37930,1.0,"As the other postings stated he is not warm and fuzzy, so if that is what you need, look else where. However he knows his stuff, so to speak.  He delievered my son in 2004. However, I choose a different practice to deliver my daughter in 2007. I found the receptionist Janice in Dr. Filipescues office to be extremly rude, mouthy and unhelpful. A week before my delivery of my 1st child she found it neccesary to tell me a horror story about how common it is for babies to die during delivery and the various ways they could die. Which this obviously sent me into a panic and I was upset and freaked out for days. I don't know if she is still there, but if she is, expect her to be annoyed to help you and do her job.  ",1
4931,37930,1.0,"i liked dr. F, he is &quot;to the point&quot;. i no longer see him, b/c i no longer live in the area, but the 3 times i went there due to my pregnancy, he was straight forward and did not waste my time. the staff was also friendly. ",1
4932,37930,1.0,"Dr. Filepescu is rude, degrading, opinionated to the point of insult, and a bad doctor too. His tone is uncaring and terse, opinions are personal and not medical and insensitive to people as human beings. I would not recommend him to anyone for anything...RUN, don't walk out of his office. He needs serious sensitivity training.  ",-1
4933,37930,1.0,"Dr. Filipescu is not only my OBGYN for the past 8 years - he was also my chemistry professor at George Washington University. He's a superb professor and a par excellence doctor as well. A bit old fashion and can come across as austere. Once you get pass the initial shock, he is quite a teddy bear.  ",1
4934,37930,1.0,"I highly discourage using Dr. Filipescu as an obstetrician. He provided little guidance other than stern, brief statements like &quot;Don't get fat&quot;. He never provided test results unless explicitly requested, and did not explain why he ordered certain tests. I found myself having to do web searches for answers rather than asking Dr. Filipescu. I ended up switching doctors halfway through my pregnancy.  ",-1
4935,37930,1.0,Dr. Filipescu performed a miracle on me with minimal invasive procedures. I had a hyterectomy and a uterine tuck totally vaginally and my uterus had to be cut in 5 sections to remove all the fibroids. I never had pain through the entire surgery or afterwards and to this day I consider him my miracle worker.  ,1
4936,37930,1.0,"Dr. Filipescu is a wonderful Doctor who without his help, we wouldn't have our 2 beautiful kids!! His medical knowledge (needing some fertility help) and patience all contributed to our 2 amazing births. Because of him we are a happy family of four and if we decide to make it five, I will definitely come back to Dr. Filipescu.  I would recommend him to anyone looking for a great Doctor! ",1
4937,37930,1.0,"I was relocated from Atlanta to DC in Nov. 2003. I had my first daughter at Northside Hospital, Atlanta. The Atlanta doctor was okay. I did not have a good experience with the aftercare at the Hospital. I was pregnant in Nov. 2005. Did not know any OB/GYN in this area. I decided to search through several websites and found this doctor. I did a lot of research on Dr. Filipescu and found his background was very impressive. I decided to give it a try. I was a little hesistant at first. As I came to his office regularly, I started liking him. He is NO NONSENSE type of doctor. But my gold was that I need an EXCELLENT doctor that I can trust to deliver my baby. In any event, I was so pleased with his service. Recently, I had a hemorrhoidectomy and was performed by Dr. Filipescu. I was extremely nervous about this surgery, because I had heard it was very painful. He was there early then the scheduled time and was holding my hand the entire time. I would NOT trust any other GYN. ",1
4938,37930,1.0,"Dr. Filipescu is genuinely cares about his patients. Whether he is able to effectively express this or not is up for debate. He tells it like it is -- no fuss, no sugar-coating. He's not comfortable with crying, and there is no point in arguing with him, but in the past 5 years, I have never considered switching.  I feel like I am in great hands with him (and his wonderful office staff!) ",1
4939,37930,1.0,"Dr. Filipescu is not an easy doctor to speak with. He speaks very argumentatively. I agree with the aforementioned statement that the exam was very painful (to say the least). It appeared he had very little, if any, patience for his patients. ",-1
4940,37930,1.0,"I certainly don't recommend gong to Dr.Filipescu. Aside from his unfriendly, stern, and &quot;no it all&quot; attitude, he grossly misdiagnosed me. As a result of his carelessness, I have paid much more to treat my problem, not to mention the pain and agony I have faced. Not a doctor that should be in practice! ",-1
4941,37930,1.0,"I recommend Dr. Filipescu, not his daughter ---HIM. If you are looking for someone who will spoil and baby you, he's not the one.. He's been my doctor for several years now and I wouldn't change him for anyone else. He is brief, but provides details if he feels it's important for you to know.. so far, he's answered every question I've had.  ",1
4942,37930,1.0,I did not like Filipescu. He is not friendly and will not listen to his patients. I received a 30 minute lecture about how my glass of wine a week will kill me. Find a different doctor.  ,-1
4943,37930,1.0,"I prefer Dr. Filipescu over the touchy-feely-in-your-business female doctors I have had. I've been going to him for several years. Very knowledgable, will answer your questions, and is quicker with the worst of the exam than other doctors. I have never thought of him as austere, but have been relieved that he's not overly chatty. I recommend him to friends and to anyone reading this. His daughter, I do not recommend as she is a little pushy, but overall, I feel well cared for as a patient of his/theirs. He is in a father/daughter practice. ",1
4944,37930,1.0,I have been a patient of Dr. Filipescu for about 9 years. He delivered my daughter in 1997 and my son in 2005. He is very thorough. My husband and I would not trust anyone else with the delivery of our children.  ,1
4945,37930,1.0,He is a good doctor. He is not warm and fuzzy so I do not recommend him if you need that but he is a good doctor. ,1
4946,37930,1.0,"Dr. Filipescu is a good dr. It is true that he is very austere, that takes some getting used to. In terms of substantive knowledge, I rate him very highly. If you're looking for someone to smile and hold your hand, he is not for you.  ",1
4947,37931,1.0,"I also think that he was making up false problems just to earn money. I didn't go back after the first appointment. My teeth are fine. If I really did have the cavity that he said I did a couple years ago, it went away. ",-1
4948,37931,1.0,"I agree 100% with the review right below.  The dentist is bery suspicious and I feel that everything he is saying is to make money.  You may or may not have anything wrong with you teeth.  He also makes you feel very uncomfortable, kinda like a typical salesman approach.  I do not recommend this doctor.  Can not trust him.  ",-1
4949,37931,1.0,"I went there because of tooth pain. X-ray was done and he recommended  root extraction and a crown. When I asked him to show me the X-ray to look at my root, it did not seem like the root was inflamed. He agreed with me but argued that I should get it done before the pain would get bigger. That made NO sense! Why extracting a root that is healthy&#63;&#63; I waited and a week later the pain was gone and nothing was wrong with my root. That was on Dec. 08. Then another visit: I thought I had cavities on a tooth where I already had a filling. He looked and said that the tooth was split. I was shocked and asked him to show me in the mirror with a light, what he was seeing. He looked again and said &quot;Oh, it looks like that only the filling is split&quot;. WHAT! This Doctor is very suspicious and I feel like he is trying to do treatments to make money!! I think a third of the ratings come from his office staff (which is around mid 20's).  A BIG NO NO NO! ",-1
4950,37931,1.0,Excellent doctor. He takes the time to explain the procedure and the options. He refers what is best for you and if he thinks is not necessary he would not recommend it. LOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE this doctor. His office and staff are excellent.  ,1
4951,37931,1.0,Everyone at this office was extremely helpful and friendly. Dr. Favis is amazing! He makes us feel like we are family. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful with all the questions reqarding my issues putting me at complete ease. The front desk was very informative with insurance information and really worked with me and my insurance to make sure i was getting the best benefits. You're crazy not to go to Dr.  Favis! ,1
4952,37931,1.0,"Dr. Favis and his entire staff are not only experts on the subject matter, but also have great bedside manner, are SO empathetic to nervous patients, proved excellent care in a comfortable way/atmosphere.  They do a great job of establishing rapport and making you feel at ease, while providing excellent dental care!  I've recommended him to everyone I see, and anyone I know that's visited them couldn't be more thankful.  ",1
4953,37931,1.0,"I had my first dental appointment here on 5/5/08. Dr. Favis is very friendly. He's knowledgable and did a quick check up/cleaning of my teeth. I'm happy with the appointment results I had and made an appointment for my next 6 month check up with him again. So far, I don't have any complaints with this practice. I'm confident his ability to keep my teeth healthy is great.  ",1
4954,37931,1.0,"Dr. Favis is great and so is his staff! I moved to the DMV area not too long ago, and the idea of finding new doctors were painful but the 4 hr. drive back and forth to Jerset didn't make much sense. After reading the comments on RateMDs.com i chose to make an appt with Dr. Favis and it was one of the best decision i have made. The office enviorment was comfortable. The office staff was professional. I didn't have a long wait time. Needless to say, I am happy! ",1
4955,37931,1.0,"Dr. Favis is a joy of a dentist. He took the time to build trust with me and explained anything that I didnt understand. He didnt try to sell me any procedures. He is a cool guy in general, even though he may talk a little too much. This isnt a bad thing, but it could make you late in getting back to work.  :-) ",1
4956,37931,1.0,"Dr. Favis and his staff are fantastic. They go the extra mile when there is a dental emergency and follow up to make sure everything is going well. Even when he moved his office further from my home & his office doesn't take my insurance coverage, I still continue to see him! ",1
4957,37931,1.0,Very friendly and goes out of his way to make you comfortable.  ,1
4958,37931,1.0,"As one who hasn't had the best healthcare experiences, I totally agree with all the positive comments of Dr. Favis. I chose him based on these ratings. But I was still nervous as I know from personal experience, that you can't always believe everything you read on a ratings board. These positive ratings were totally accurate. ",1
4959,37931,1.0,"Dr. Favis and his STAFF were very kind and helpful. He takes the time to explain everything to you, and gives you your options and let's you choose which course you want to take.

4965,37931,1.0,"First off, Dr. Favis is a super nice guy. He explains everything and incorporates your thoughts into decisions about your care.

4967,37932,0.0,Dr. Fergusson has set my boy Luke in the right direction and attended to his health issues that stemmed from another problem that was recognized by the doctor as she became familiar with my boy. We hold you in highest regards.  John N.   Thank you so much ! ,1
4968,37932,0.0,Dr. Fergusson and her staff are great and my family has been patients for years. She is professional at all times and has become our trusted advisor. I don't understand the negative comments posted here in another review. Dr.  Fergusson is a GREAT doctor and I highly recommend her! ,1
4969,37932,0.0,"I am very unhappy with Dr. Fergusson.  I shouldn't have gone back after the last time I left in tears because she was condescending and unhelpful.  Today was the same, but in addition, I was the first appointment and still had to wait an hour with my child while she talked on the phone, and she didn't even acknowledge that she had kept us waiting.  Her quick check of my child left me feeling like it was not an adequate enough assessment to really know if he if he doing ok for his age or if there are any red flags as far as his health.  He was tired from the wait, and she was unwilling to check everything that I was concerned about because he was crying.  The last time we were there she also acted like she did not have the time for us.  She called me a &quot;worry wart&quot; for having questions about his habits and development, which I feel was incredibly inappropriate.  When I take half a day off work to see her, I expect her time and respect.  I won't waste my time or emotions there again. ",-1

He has never made me feel like I was imposing on his time - quite the contrary - he addresses every concern and, although it may mean waiting from time to time as he is very thorough, you can rest assured you are getting the best quality care possible! Dr. Filak is so knowledgable about the latest medical developments, I have stopped going to an endochronologist as they have never provided any better guidance than Dr. Filak has and endochronology is not even his speciality!  Aside from being incredibly pleasant to work with, Dr.  Filak is very patient, listens without rushing, and provides sound and competent advice that has never steered me wrong! ",1

4979,37936,0.0,Dr. F is a wonderful psychologist! I have issues with weight and depression and we have worked to resolve so many emotional aspects. She is the best therapist I've ever been to. I found Dr. F. after trying two other therapists that didn't have time to schedule new patients. The value I get out of our sessions keeps me grounded and focused. Treatment is the best gift I've been able to give my self! I can honestly say that Dr. F has saved my life and enriched the quality of my life with her approach to our sessions.  Dr. F will give you all the tools to peel back the layers of unhealthy behaviors and steer you toward the path to self discovery and honesty. ,1
4980,37936,0.0,"I had a great experience with Dr. Fellenberg. I have a long history of anxiety and depression, and she proved to be very knowledgeable, warm and compassionate in her approach. I particularly liked her integration of mind-body techniques into the therapy session. She was always punctual, organized and had great memory. I was glad that she didn't take notes during the session, as I would have found that quite distracting. I think she made her notes after my visits.  I never had a billing issues and got statements sent to me promptly.  I would highly recommend her, if you are looking for a warm, caring, and easy to relate to therapist. She was such an asset in my journey to well-being. ",1
4981,37936,0.0,"Dr. Fellenberg was the worst therapist I've ever had. She never took any notes, it took her a couple of months to remember my husband's name and get details straight. Our sessions never seemed to have any focus or goal. Total waste of time and money. Also, when I had to travel etc., I would tell her verbally that I would be out of town. One time she charged me for a missed session even though I DID tell her in advance that I would be out of town. And she charged the WHOLE amount. I called her and asked her about this and reminded her that I told her and she said she would refund me. Two months later and I'm still waiting on my check. I doubt I will ever see the refund, it's her word against mine. Bottom line, she just seemed very glib about therapy but quick to collect her money. I wouldn't waste my time on her if you're looking for a caring therapist. ",-1

I did not appreciate the attitude at the receptionist desk. I have seen him numerous times &amp; I feel he is a nice person but just not for me.  ",-1

4984,37937,1.0,"Very intelligent AND caring AND humorous - It is rare to find ALL THREE traits in ONE doctor, but Dr. Ferrar is all three things!  His knowledge is as good as a beginning specialist, in most of the major specialty areas, so I seldom feel the need to go see a specialist, since I can just ask HIM and be confident that his answer is correct. His kind-heartedness has gotten me through several sad times. If I ever move to a different city, I wish I could take HIM with me (as my doctor).  ",1

4992,37942,1.0,I just happend to find this page and it made me smile.  My sons were patients of Dr. Felice's father when he was a pediatrician in Brooklyn.  It seems that his son has continued the tradition.  Our Dr. Felice was the most caring loving and giving doctor I have ever met.  He worked tirelessly til all hours of the night.  Never once was he unavailable.  The Felice family are lovely people who always sacrificed the time of the their husband/father for the sake of his patients.  Sounds like his son is a chip off the old block.  His father would be very very proud.  I had to write this comment because they still feel like family to all of us who were honored to know them. ,1
4993,37942,1.0,"The negative comment posted is NOT AT ALL reflective of Dr. Felice.  I have been going to Dr. Felice for over 8 years as having been treated for breast cancer. He was highly recommended to me and I know I could not have found someone better to manage my treatment and recover.  He was compassionate during my scariest moments.  He immediately had a plan for how he was going to treat my cancer and attacked it aggressively and successfully. As busy as he is, when you see him, you feel like he is totally focused on you and that you are his only patient at that point in time when you know you are not. He made my husband feel secure and confident. His office staff is amazing. You know they are because so many of them are still there. They are extremely positive and professional. The chemo nurses are the awesome, the person managing your meds are on top of everything! When you are a patient of Dr. Felice, the only thing you need to worry about is getting well! A.  Rogers ",1
4994,37942,1.0,"This guy is horrible. He is lazy and doesn't care. After my mom's cancer spread I asked her to move in to Va so I could help take care of her. Her Oncologist referred us to this guy. He came in to the appointment looking annoyed like &quot;what do you expect me to do for you&#63;&quot; He would be chewing food from his lunch and anytime we asked a question he would say &quot;I don't know, I have to review your file&quot;. After the third appointment and he hadn't reviewed the file, we were extremely annoyed. He obviously didn't care. Horrible bedside manner. If he's that tired and hungry, maybe he should retire, eat and sleep all day. I'm sure he's made good money off of practicing bad medicine. Please find a better Oncologist and read each review, not just the overall score. This guy sucks. ",-1
4995,37942,1.0,"Dr. Felice is one of the most caring doctors I have ever had. I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago and I am still doing well with his help and expertise. After hearing his recommendations, Dr. Felice allows his patients to make up their own minds, without condemnation, and will work with them as a team. He is open to complementary medicine methods, as long as they are up front with him, so he can help guide them as to the best time, and best way to use them. He is the one doctor I actually look forward to seeing, even though it's only once a year now. ",1

Unfortunately, I had to move from the area and have yet to find a physician who is half the man he is and miss him very much.

5007,37946,1.0,Wow! I just saw Dr. Ferguson for the first time. My wait was a little long but he was worth waiting for. The staff were very curtious and he made me feel like I was his only patient. I will be bringing my whole family back to see him.  ,1
5008,37946,1.0,Dr. Ferguson is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  He never makes you think that he is in a hurry to get rid of you.  He takes his time to find out all your concerns and addresses them.  He has a great bedside manner.  ,1
5009,37946,1.0,"Dr. Ferguson is a good doctor who takes his time and never rushes the patient.  This does tend to make him get behind schedule, but I would rather wait for him than someone who treats patients like they are part of a production line.  ",1

5011,37948,1.0,"Good doctor.  He can seem to be in a hurry but will answer questions.  The administrative staff at his practice is a problem however:  the simple act of having records sent to another Dr. took far too much time, energy and follow-up or it didn't get done.  ",1

There are some things I ask her that she may not be familiar with, but she always tells me where to go for the information I need. My calls are returned in a timely manner and I've found her to be a very pleasant, caring individual.  ",1

She falls a little short because she is so distant from patients. Also, when i ran into trouble with substance abuse, she was unable to help me at all and told me to use another doctor since she had no knowledge in that area. I feel like she should be versed in this area if she's trying to treat depression. good doctor for getting you back on your feet and effectively managing medications.  ",1

I've never met a pediatrician who was so patient and caring. He let's the kids handle his instruments and explain what he's going to do (listen to the heart, look in the ears, etc.) before he does it. It's a lot lesst scary for them and they actually look forward to going to the Dr.'s. My kids are only 2 & 3 but he treats them like they're people, talks to them not down at them. I also like that he doesn't over prescribe antibiotics, so if he gives them medicine I know that they REALLY need it.  ",1

She emails me constantly to check up on my status and if I have any other issues non-related to Endocronology/OB GYN - she answers my questions the best she can and/or directs me to who (what doctor) I should see. I want to become pregnant and she is the only one I feel can get me on the right track in doing so.  But her main priority ALWAYS is being healthy.. and she will be the first person waiting for you at the finish line when that happens! ,1
5028,37951,0.0,"Dr. Farahmand is THE BEST OB/GYN specialist I've ever consulted with. She is extremely knowledgeable about her field – it’s obvious what one can learn from 25 years of practicing at Harvard Affiliated Brigham & Women’s Hospital! I had some serious complications with my pregnancy. Dr. Farahmand was very thorough in explaining to me, in layman’s terms, what was going on with my conditions and what treatment options she would recommend. She spent a lot of time with her patients – a rarity in today’s managed care environment – I have always been able to reach her by phone or by email during evenings and weekends.  ",1

5030,37952,1.0,"As a new patient never actually saw the Doctor.  The front desk did not understand insurance procedures, refused to speak with the insurance company and demanded I pay for the visit up front and deal with their lack of insurance knowledge later.  They were Soooo! rude, I left without seeing the Doctor.  After reading these reviews wish I had done so before making appointment.  Just went by insurance company roster. ",-1
5031,37952,1.0,"DR DIFFICULT. Never have had such unpleasant and unprofessional behavior from a so called professional in my life,until this guy. All the warnings are true about him. Stay away from this arrogant combative and disrespectful guy. Not only was his behavior unacceptable, but he then wouldn't release my medical records to my new doc and I had to have my insurance co. plus my PCP contact him reminding him to release them. Can we say immature&#63;  Not to mention, I had to file a grievance about him, and apparently I am not the only one of his EX patients to do so. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but its odd to find a plethora of past patients to question his reputation. My entire experience can be summed up in 4 words-COLLOSAL WASTE OF TIME.  ",-1
5032,37952,1.0,"Best foot doctor in the east coast! Treated me and my 5 year old and myself professionally, efficiently, and without pushing surgery..eventhough he does lots of surgery. Staff was very nice as well which is always a plus for me.  ",1

There is zero coordination between his offices, you can't even transfer records or appointments within his organization!  The epitome of the arrogant, ego-centric doctor.  He treated us like we were chattel and demanded we rate him as &quot;above average&quot; before we left his office.  He pretended to answer questions, but only in a combative manner, pointing out imagined slights and accusing us of not holding our end of the bargain.  Unacceptable behavior from a supposed professional. ",-1

He does a quick but complete head to toe exam (one of the best I've seen...and I used to work as a nurse before I became a mom). He seems to be a good common sense doc.

Six months later she gave a very rough rectal exam that left me with hemroidal discomfort months aftwards. Presence of hemroids was in my medical records. Rough exam may have created new hemroids. Furthermore, exam was unnecessarily (clear fecal smear test in last six months) and I did not receive an annual prostrate exam. Created a false sense of urgency about seeing a private dermatologist to examine a mole in the small of my back (which I could not see) after a virtual consultation with a VA dermatologist two months earlier, who could have looked at the mole at the same time. Seems to be a fearful personality, and her manner with me has been stilted during three visits.

I have never seen another doctor make this commitment to her patients.  She is very thorough, rather than just taking 10 minutes with you to measure your belly and quickly check your baby's heart beat, she monitors your baby's heart beat for several minutes and also does an ultrasound (herself) each visit to make sure nothing is missed.  If you want just on-time, quick visits, then she is not the doctor for you.  If you want extra attention for yourself and your baby, she should be your top choice.  My baby's weight was a little bit of a concern and I was having premature contractions, so at one point she asked me to call her daily on her cell phone to check in, and had me coming in 2-3 times per week, just to make sure my baby was safe and healthy.

After a few bad experiences with other doctors I found Dr Fauzia and she has always taken really good care of me.The way she talks is extremely polite and I fail to understand that she spoke to you in a hateful manner.My friends have visited her too and they were all treated respectfully and on scheduled time.She is the only doctor who gives her number for emergencies.As for privacy she always closes the door. You said it yourself that there is no other staff because her husband works with her.No one is allowed in the area where she is doing the examinations.She has always been very kind to all her patients.If you had so many complaints I would suggest you call her and tell her because she doesn't mind criticism because she feels that makes one a better person if they correct it.It would be very nice of you if you didn't write all the wrong and insulting things about her.Thankyou ,1
5076,37967,0.0,She was the worst doctor I have ever encountered.  I was in absolute tears after my visits.   She treated me hatefully and when I transferred my care to another doctor called me several times and interfered with the transfer of my records. She has no staff in her clinic.  I had to wait 3 hours to be seen on my first visit.   The only other person there other than her is her husband who answers the phone.  She leaves the door open while she does pelvic exams and does not provide anything to cover yourself with leaving your body exposed.  She saves the paper towels that she drys her hands with on top of her computer in a stack to wash the floors with.  She does not draw blood or perform tests in her office.  In the bathroom there are tooth brush holders that all her patients use to place the sticks they are to pee on before being seen...gross! I can't tell you enough not to go there!

She delivered all three of my babies, and has always been extremely involved- probably one of the very few MD's who hand out there cell number to all their patients. She is also intensely proactive, and was able to detect my mother's cervical cancer early on, giving her- with the grace of God- a second chance at life.It is much easier to get an appointment with Dr. Fauzia, as opposed to other specialists- where the wait time to be seen can range anywhere between several weeks to several months.

She takes the time to answer any and all of your questions and does her best to alleviate any concerns you may have. She will even go so far as to give you her own personal cell phone number, and actually answers the phone when you call!  If you are afraid she encourages you to pray, when you are happy she shares your joy. She is understanding and kind. I will be forever grateful to have been able to be introduced to her. It is hard for me to go to other physicians' offices now, as she has set the standard way above any expectations.  ",1
5087,37967,0.0,"I recently had my first child and Dr. Fauzia was my doctor throughout my pregnancy. I cannot express enough how pleased I am with the care she provided. She was personally available day or night to assuage any concern I had and always made time in her schedule if I needed to be seen. When I went into labor, she slept at the hospital overnight so that she would be there when the time came. She is so kind, patient, and dedicated. She is one of a kind and my pregnancy experience was so much better because of her.  ",1

With an outpatient surgery .after one month with the help of God my wife was pregnant .I had 3 baby girls and in all of them doctor Fauzia was not doctor to my wife but Mother.She honors my wife request to have vaginal delivery. 2 weeks ago my wife was on the hospital for delivery. The Nurse reported that my wife still have 10 hrs.to  deliver, Dr. Fauzia agree but she said that she  will be waiting in the doctor room because her hart told her not to leave the hospital. In 1.5 hrs. My wife was having the Baby and Dr. Fauzia was there for the delivery. Dr. Fauzia Hart told her not to go because she care about patient first .Thanks Dr. Fauzia and God give you the reward.  ",1
5089,37967,0.0,"I decided to wait the whole 9 months before giving a rating to guarantee a thorough, objective, and complete experience rating. Dr. Fauzia has been the best thing that happened to me as an expectant mom. I had tried a couple of OBGYNs before and had a horrible experience. She is a good listener, personable, patient, and knowledgeable. She gave me her Cell number to call her whenever I have a question or concern throughout my pregnancy. She also respected my wish to have a vaginal delivery, and did everything possible to make sure it was so. During a couple of emergency situations she took me in on the same day. During more than 20 visits we never felt like we were being rushed. She always made sure she answered all our questions before leaving her office. She successfully built the necessary trust and bond between me as the patient and her as the doctor, and oh boy that's very critical when the big Day comes: She went out of her way and spent about 16 hours with me @ the hospital.

5090,37967,0.0,Dr.Fauzia...There are no words to explain about her...she is the best doctor. She has lots of experience in her field and lots of patience to listen to each and every concern of mine very patiently.      She made me feel comfortable by explaining all procedures in detail. She was available anytime on her cell for any questions we had.I have been going to her for the past 4 years and had a baby last month. Her staff have been very helpful.

5092,37967,0.0,"I highly recommend Dr Fauzia.  She listens carefully to her patients, never rushes appointments, is very accommodating to working moms' schedules, and is very knowledgeable and skilled. When delivering my first child, the labor was very long and doctor Fauzia stayed by my side for more than 10 hours to make sure that everything was going smoothly and do whatever she could to let me deliver naturally as I wanted.  Despite the difficulty, I was at peace through the whole process knowing that mine and the baby's health were her top concern and she would step in if a C-section or other any other intervention were needed for a safe delivery.  She was even up at all hours during winter shoveling her driveway in case I went into labor during the big snow storm and stayed at the hospital the night before I delivered.  She also schedules evening or weekend appointments to accommodate work schedules.  Her patience, dedication to her patients, and skill make her a fantastic OB/GYN.  ",1
5093,37967,0.0,"My girlfriend and I wanted to her to have a natural birth and Dr. Fauzia was very supportive of our wishes, saying that the only way she would ever intervene and have to ignore our birth plan was if something was wrong and the baby or mom was in danger.  She respected what was most important to us as patients and a family.  Because there were no complications, she helped us avoid an episiotomy by stretching the mom's perineum during the birth.  She also was very willing to answer any questions we had during the months prior to birth which was very reassuring to us as first time parents.  We also felt very comfortable knowing Dr. Fauzia's dedication to her work, which to her, is not work but a lifestyle.  Her sister and Husband work in her office, and she is on call 24 hours a day, which I guess must be how an OB must operate, but Dr. Fauzia seems to take it a step further.  ",1

In India, we believe that God comes and helps in the disguise of man/woman.  When my son and daughter in law were searching for a good Gynecologist in and around VA, it was by the Grace of God that they could zero in on your name and address.     Earlier in Feb 6,2009 you had almost performed a miracle in removing the Fibroid from Archana's abdoman, that had paved the way for conceiving the baby.  Now you had reenacted by enabling the safe  delivery  of   our sweet, cute little grand daughter on 10th March 2010.

5096,37967,0.0,"My mother requested my wife and I to switch our Doctor to Dr.Fauzia. I remembered Dr.Fauzia served my mother very well  after she gave birth to my baby sister years ago. So my wife and I decided we should see her. Dr. Fauzia screened my wife well and advised us through my wife's pregnancy. Not only did we receive HONEST AND ACCURATE MEDICAL advice, but she was pleasant to answer personal non-medical questions. Surprisingly, we learned life lessons from Dr.Fauzia that can carry past a pregnancy.  She works around the clock everyday sacrificing her time for her patients. You must have compassion, patience, and determination to work like that.I have never known any doctor that works everyday. It would be nice if Doctors were more like her. I would advice anyone if you want excellent medical examination, honesty, reliability, and compassion to stick with Dr.Fauzia as we plan to.We thank the Lord that we found someone like her. ",1
5097,37967,0.0,I have been a Patient of Doctor Fauzia for 10 years. My 9 years old twins and 3 years old son were delivered by her.  She is compassionate phsyican with a great bedside manner. Doctor Fauzia has provided a service beyond my expectations.  I have even called her middle of the night and she drove to the clinic and saw me during the my last preganancy.   Doctor Fauzia extensive knowledge of Medicine and Religious knowledge gave me great comfort through my preganancies.  I admire her and highly recommend her to my family and to my friends.

5099,37967,0.0,"I recently had a second trimester miscarriage. Originally I was with a different obgyn but due to some complications and being referred to a specialist I was left at a dead end and told to go home until I had a miscarriage. That is when I went to visit Dr Fauzia, I wish I had gone earlier perhaps my baby would still be alive right now. She tried to save my baby all week but it was gods will and not meant to be. But in the week I was with Dr Fauzia she was there for me 24-7 she gave me the most unconditional attention you can hope for. Even after my miscarriage she waited at the hospital to carry out the d&c; on me. All I can say is that every doctor works differently. People have written here that she is concerned with money only which I believe is to be false. She is very upfront and truthful about everything and some people cannot handle that.  I feel a lot of people have cheated her to earned money and now she is direct do you blame her&#63;Best doctor you can have for you and your baby! ",1
5100,37967,0.0,"I guess God create human being for purpose but most of us will forget why we are here except few of us. Dr Fauzi Mutahar is a person with the mission that set her goal not in this worldly life only she expands it beyond that. Let me try to describe her: - Person who has enough experience, knowledge and passion about what she is doing/practicing - Person who fear God and know there is accountability some day after death so she is very careful person in her practice and follow the rule and procedure of the country plus the rule of humanity which is consensus of God - Her mission is not to accumulate money or after name rather she sees it as God put her in charge of this position to test her and she tries her best to full fill the duty and the trust/position God gave her with full of love and passion.      It is hard to find a Dr. that listen and understand your problem. I suggest to anyone to go with her and get the best service that I have received.  Aziza Ebrahim and Seid min ",1
5101,37967,0.0,I feel so blessed to have Dr. Fauzia looking out for me.  She has detected medical problems that no other ob/gyn has ever found before.  She is the most caring and knowledgeable doctor I have ever had and always gives advice that is in my best interest.  I have recommended her to family in other states because she is absolutely worth the trip.  May God continue to bless her and those who acknowledge her good work.  ,1
5102,37967,0.0,"Dr.Fauzia is a God given gift to humanity!!One night,due to some cramping I had to go to the ER.After some testing they did a trasvaginal US & told me there was nothing there & most probable it was an Ectopic or what they call a liquid pregnancy.This was very freightning news for me being that I had an ectopic a few months ago.I then went to Dr.Fauzia 2 days later (I researhed OBGYN(S) in my area & went to her based on her ratings).She IMMEDIATELY spotted the pregnancy in my uterus!I then realized how valuable it is to have a knwledgeable and hands on Dr.such as Dr.Fauzia,that privides this level of service.Dr.Fauzia's approach is much more effective!It allows you to have an immediate & accurate response.Keep in mind that Dr.s' today very much rely on Techs & eventhough it may not always be the case;if the proper pictures are not taken or anything vital is not spotted during an US.You will not have the right diagnosis,as it happened to me. She is VERY competent & is EXTREMELY dedicated! ",1
5103,37967,0.0,I have 4 children and 2 have been delivered by Dr.Fauzia. Dr. Fauzia has been the most thorough and overly cautious doctors I have visited. Not many OBs do sonograms regularly in their office usually you get one or two sonos during the pregnancy and you have to go elsewhere to have them done. So to have one done everytime is a blessing. Each visit I have to Dr.Fauzia she is so appreciative that I drive all the way from Maryland to see her. Moreover she asks me each time if there is anything she has done to upset me then I should correct her. I have never seen anyone be so humble. She stays with the patients during the time of delivery. Whereas other OBs are called in only when you are completely ready. She has been a very good doctor and I have been moved by her words of wisdom.I highly recommend her to all of my friends and family.  ,1
5104,37967,0.0,"I have been a patient of Dr. Fauzia's for several years and based on this tenure, consider her not only an excellent physician, but a friend as well. I had seen her for normal gynological visits for some years and then she discovered ovarian cysts. I tend to research everything and question most any diagnosis, so any advice she provided to me, I thoroughly vetted and analyzed prior to moving forward with any treatment. In the end, her advice was generally accurate and her treatment superior. I have recently delivered my first child with her. Although she may not have agreed with some of my birth preferences or considered them feasible, in the end my birth was all that I dreamed of and she came through for me like no other doctor would. My only criticism is that she tends to focus on the negative potential outcomes, in order to fully disclose all potential consequences, which could leave the patient discouraged. When push comes to shove, however, she will do all for the best outcome.  ",1
5105,37967,0.0,"Mutahar is a wonderful doctor with a personal touch. Initially we had to wait long time but later we scheduled our visits according to Dr.'s timings and we never had complained again. The staff is wonderful especially her husband, he explains medical details clearly and patiently. Mostly I have to thank her for being available to us at all times... &quot;Call me anytime&quot; she says. So we called midnight few times and we got response back immediately. One more thing worth mention is...when Dr.Muthahar asks you pray or leave everything to God, don't be intimidated!! She more capable than many other doctors. Try googling her name and see what she is capable of...I would definitely go to her again when we plan 2nd kid.  ",1

5108,37967,0.0,"I came to Dr. Fauzia totally unaware of the fact that I was pregnant. I therefore came to her with many complications. Through her experience in using ultrasounds she told me that the baby's head and the placenta were not in the right position. I took her advise and just prayed. During the delivery the baby's heart rate also got distrubed, and so she quickly did a c-section to save both of us. She says to pray to God and He helps, I can easily say that God helped me through her. My youngest daughter is a miracle for me, a miracle that was only possible because of her knowledge, experience, and support through out the pregnancy. ",1
5109,37967,0.0,"This is a very unknowledgeable doctor. This will be our first child, and it has been the worse experience relating to doctor. From the very first visit it has gone wrong. My whole mistake was to stay with this lady instead of looking for a doctor. The practice is unprofessional, the doctor is in a rush. She expects one to wait even after an appointment is made. the whole pregnancy she has not even touched and done a manual exam on my wife, all she does is a sonogram and charges the hell out of my insurance. a regular OB sono lasts around 30 - 45 minutes, yes its very detailed and they give you pictures, either hardcopy of a disk. this lady charges teh same amount as a regular OB sonogram and only does it for 10 - 15 minutes, no hardcopy or anything. I mean she preaches about how she has to answer to Allah, I will hold her to this inshallah. horrible dr.  ",-1

5111,37967,0.0,"I was extremely disastisfied with the &quot;service&quot; I received at this office. 1) I had to wait up to 2 hours to be seen. 2) Her office staff is incredibly unprofessional.  In terms of patient privacy, I find it apalling that the office staff would ask me what prescriptions I needed in front of the entire waiting room.  3) I had a major issue with them using the wrong diagnostic code on my lab tests.  I ended up being charged several times when all the doctors office had to do was call the lab company to change their mistake.  It took the doctors office 4 months and the lab company calling THEM to get a response so I could get a refund. 4) The doctor did not address my concerns and was extremely judgemental. Her idea of treatment actually made my problem worse.  In the process I ended up spending a lot of money with no improvement.  Save yourself a great deal of trouble and do not go to this extraordinarily unprofessional office. ",-1
5112,37967,0.0,"I'd like to share my experience in hopes of enlightening all. In 2002 I was bleeding profusely for more than a month; I was very frail and facing sure death but unable to see a doctor because I didn't have insurance. But then I was referred to Dr Fauzia whose utmost concern, above anything else, was my well being. She was kind enough to save my life, I on the other hand was a total jerk, once cured I forgot all about her and my payment arrangement with her. In 2007 I was in desperate need of her help again. But I didn't expect for her to help me because of my past payment history, regardless of my fears I approached her, and sure enough once again she showed the utmost concern for my health. I am truly ashamed of negligence in paying her as promised in the past. But must admit she is kind to a fault, a doctor that stands out when it comes to being concerned and caring for her patients. Only if there were more doctors like her. May God bless her for all the good she shows to others! ",1

We've recommended Dr Fauzia to our friends and they now have a lovely girl, we've noticed that Dr Fauzia actively involves the Dad-to-be with small tasks through the pregnancy, this preperation was a great help when managing the newborn.  From the onset we knew its quite difficult for my wife to conceive and we put our faith firmly in Dr Fauzia and her team, thanks to them we're new expecting! Dr Fauzia is also an excellent counsellor, she's been so helpful to our family.  There is more to being a good doctor than administering medicines, Dr Fauzia is one of the finest doctors We've come across. I am especially happy that she's imparting the same culture to her daughters - Halema takes speical care of us, we wish her the best. Her team deserves a special mention. Thank you all.  ",1
5114,37967,0.0,"Few years ago my gynecologist told me that I needed a hysterectomy. As for young woman this news was devastating. Dr. Fauzia was recommended to me, so I went for a second opinion and found that I am a healthy woman and have a great chance to have children. She recommended a much less extensive surgery, which went very successfully. I was so much touched that Dr. Fauzia prays for every patient, for their tests, for their surgery, for their pregnancy. I felt that she was like a second mother when she prepared me for surgery. She was so happy after the success of the surgery; she was very happy that now I have an opportunity to have children. I’ve never seen such of kind, caring and professional doctor in my life. I always recommend Dr. Fauzia to my friends. Good bless you, Dr. Fauzia.  ",1
5115,37967,0.0,"I'm glad that I decided to choose Dr. Fauzia as my physician for many reasons. First of all, she's a wonderful and genuine person who cares for her patients (she's available 24/7!). Secondly, she let's you get involved with your own healthcare. Her staff is nice-her older daughter, a med student who works at her office, is very diligent and caring to everyone. Waiting is a real issue at her office, however, especially if you take an evening appointment. It's best to make morning or afternoon appointment, I learned this the hard way after spending a Friday evening waiting at her office. But don't be discouraged, even though i waited, I got the answers that I needed. ",1

5117,37967,0.0,There are several reasons I would not reccomend any one to Dr. Fauzia's clinic. 1) She has an unprofessional staff who are unprofessional and have no idea how to welcome patients at the clinic.2)It is a norm that scheduled patients are delayed atleat 30minutes at times. 3)She is unable to give undivided attention to the patient. She has no recollection of the patient history and would care less who the patient is. 4) She is especially concerned with INSURANCE and will make sure your insurance is WORTH HER time. Otherwise she will not see you for an appointment. 5)The environment is very chaotic and unsettling for the patient. 6)She does not have a PROPER NURSE on her staff at all. We found out that people on her staff were part of her family. 7)We found that she is not discreet about patient privacy and money is an important factor to her. 8) She would care less if the patient was dying and has medicare insurance. I would advise cuation to this Physician who has no medical ethics.  ,-1

5120,37969,0.0,Went for laser hair removal knowing anything about it fetched up $300 and got 7 treatments.  Her treatments include rolling cold metal up and down  and were very painful  that left horrible blisters.  I naively thought that is the way it was.. and did not get mad until one treatment she missed a spot.   6 weeks later I had this highly  visible strip of hair.  When I went back to her she shrugged and said I would have to pay the 300 dollars for the spot she missed!  Finally I wised up and googled laser treatment for men and found a place for 75 dollars.  Their machine didnt blister me hurt at all and didnt involve some antiquated metal rollers.  They told me she must have a very old machine when I told them.  I assume she is to cheap to buy a newer machine.  Also every appointment she is 30 min to an hour late and one time even forgot I was in the room.  My biggest regret is I paid her to torture me 7 times.  Truly nasty doctor out for every last penny she can get. ,-1

5122,37969,0.0,"What a great doctor! Firstly, I have extreme allergies, eczema and atopic dermatitis. Rather than give me a bunch of steroids, she is the first doctor in a very long time to explain the possible causes for this dreaded disease (which in my case may be food based, bacteria, or other possible causes). She will tell you to read up on the SCD diet in order to educate yourself on foods. This material can be found online. Be advised,  she utilizes both conventional methodologies and a variety of natural healing processes as well. Although I’ve only had two sessions with her, I am at peace in that I’ve finally found a dermatologist who I feel is trying her best to get to the root causes of my condition as opposed to just masking the symptoms with drugs. She definitely gets 5 BIG STARS per my experience.  ",1

I wasted a lot of time and $ following her treatment for her initial diagnosis only to be told it was an incorrect diagnosis (her words) and then had to pay $150 for a scalp biopsy which still left Dr. Faria without a clue as to what was going on, and she even recommended that I see another dermatologist with more knowledge...not very comforting to know she doesn't feel she has enough expertise after just cutting into my scalp.

In the short 2 weeks between I got my first positive pregnancy test at 4 weeks and the news about miscarriage I had 5 blood test done to check my hCG. This is before even one doctor saw me. Clearly too many tests for a non-high risk pregnancy. Answer - they take blood tests on-site and more tests translate into more money for the practice.

I chose to wait and get another u/s 10 days later and it took the office 2 days to give me the results of a stat ultrasound. I chose to go to another doctor who blows these guys out of the water.

One doctor, I think it was Dr. Wilson, actually told me I took too much time asking questions (I had 2!) so she was now late for her next appt (and she was late for my appt, even though I was on time). My last delivery was very painful, even with an epidural.  I pushed for hours and was in agony, they did nothing for the pain.  I am now pregnant for the 2nd time and went for 8 wk appt.  Met yet another new doc w/ the practice, she didn't even bother to ask how I was feeling or if I had any questions regarding the pregnancy.  I waited about 20 min. freezing in the exam room.

They always said that cramping was normal and the bleeding too, but never asked me to see a Doctor. All they ever did was check blood all the time.  I had to have 2 consecutive d & c and no one really explains why&#63; ",-1

The nurse's station was very kind on the phone *during* my miscarriage, though I will say they were a little insensitive the following day. I have never waited very long in the waiting room or for the doctor or nurse to come into the examination rooms. Dr. Felluca spent considerable time with me AND my husband when discussing fertility strategies and was extremely helpful, encouraging, and willing to take the time to talk to us in depth. This is more attention than I think I've ever received from any OB/GYN in my lifetime. We are now having a successful pregnancy and I'm looking forward to working with the rest of the doctors at the practice.  ",1

She was rude and scared me, telling me that I wasn't in pain and that I would &quot;become bed-ridden&quot; and have colon problems like a &quot;60-year-old.&quot; I started to cry. She wasn't even making sense. I ended up having my mom check me out of the hospital; Dr. Felluca had decided to override the orders for pain contol. Before I left, she did apologize to me, after speaking with my very-upset mother. But then, Dr. Felluca went and had a long talk with Dr. Patel, who was then my current GYN. When I went to follow-up with Dr. Patel, she told me, and I quote &quot;there's nothing else we can do for you.&quot; Before her talk with Felluca we'd made a list of birth controls to try to control the cysts.

I haven't seen my doctor since I was 10 weeks along despite several appointments with her. I've seen the physicians assistant more than anyone and while she's pretty nice, she's not Dr. Felluca. Like most of the people that posted here I've spent countless hours in their waiting room and been subjected to their &quot;rude&quot; staff. I've witnessed multiple office fights with staff (non-doctors) and the receptionists harassing or berating patients.

Felluca is hard to see, but she did deliver my baby and I feel she did a great job (although, I have easy deliveries). I shopped around, A LOT, and believe me, this practice is as good as it gets in the NOVA area. I am quite picky. As far as the receptionist goes, other practices in that area have much worse receptionist. My only problem with the practice is that after I had the baby and had an issue 2 years later, the nurse told me they couldn't help me and told me to find somewhere else. I wouldn't waste your time with many of the other pracitces in the area. If you want kind, patient, understanding doctors - I really think these are the best.  ",1

They said I can't see the doctor if I don't pay it now. All they want is your money. I suggest Felluca and Santiago, they are very nice and professional. Some aren't. I went for a prescription which should be kept more confidential. But they said it out loud in front of the waiting area. I was embarassed. DO NOT SCHEDULE WITH HORTON OR PATEL.

I ended up spending 2 days and too much money taking additional tests to ensure that everything was &quot;fixed&quot; when I could have had everything resolved in one night.

She was very supportive of my decision to not risk my babies life with an amnio. However, I left nearly every appointment holding back tears as she continually relayed the worst case scenarios.

She knew I wanted a natural birth and didn't even suggest a c-section. She just explained what they were going to have to do to induce and I asked about the c-section.

I requested he not use mercury fillings as I have an autoimmune disorder and he told me he WOULD use a mercury based amalgam as it is safer than the new filling materials. He indicated that I did not know what I was talking about. He failed to us a topical anesthesia prior to injecting the anesthesia or make reasonable effort to avoid my discomfort during the proceedure: he bruised my lips and put impliments in my mouth, leaned me back and left the room; during this time I had trouble with choking. When Dr. Farmer was finished repairing/filling the molar he started to leave and I asked him about the other fillings. He told me had decided to not fill them at this time, that fillings on the gumline tended to break down over time and would have to be redone in about five years. He said he had decided to just wait five years and then fill them. ",-1
5209,37986,1.0,"Dr Mercola is one of the best doctors that I know/had experience with in the past. He did have an emergency several times and did not show up for the appointment - but hey, we are all humans, right&#63; How often did I have an emergency and did not come to work&#63; His staff tried to contact me as soon as they could - one time i did not check my messages, so it was my fault. the other time, I was standing in their office already when I received a call from them - but they did call. I do not consider this an issue and will continue seeing this doctor - he is knowledgeable with great bed side manners.  ",1
5210,37986,1.0,"I waited in the exam room about 20 minutes before learning from the office staff that Dr. Feola WAS NOT THERE. He simply did not arrive for the appointment. No one told me that when I arrived for my appointment. His staff handled the situation in an incredibly rude way. His partner, Dr. Klein, then attempted to see me, but he was so rude that I couldn't even bring myself to talk to him. I can't believe these people are in business.  ",-1
5211,37986,1.0,"Office was dirty and staff was rude.  Doctor did not show up on time, and the doctor who filled in was rude.  Left the office in tears. ",-1
5212,37986,1.0,"Dr. Feola is by far one of the BEST doctors I have ever had. I have been a patient of his for over 5 years, and he has always been very helpful, easy to talk to, a good listener, and doesn't rush the appointment. He is very knowledgeable and thorough. He's the best of both worlds - great medical skills paired with great bedside manner. He has also given me good recommendations for specialists when needed. He has gotten me through some scary medical issues, and I always felt like I was in good hands.  Keep up the good work! :) ",1
5213,37986,1.0,Hands down the most caring doctor I have ever seen!  He is awesome! ,1
5214,37987,1.0,"I really like Dr. Falls personally and I like that he takes the time to familiarize himself with my chart before he sees me. This at least gives the appearance that he remembers me although it's unlikely because he only sees me once a year. However, I agree with one of the other assessments that waiting 6 months to see him is just ridiculous. He does have the most unfriendly staff too. While other doctors will call you if they have a cancellation, this office does not do that. They suggest that you call back every day to see if there's been a cancellation. Who has the time to do that&#63; Additionally, they've got the worst voice mail message on their machine that I have ever heard! I inquired about coming to pick up my records so I could switch doctors and was told there was a charge for that. Why do I have to pay for my own medical history when it takes 6 months to get an appt.  with my doctor&#63; ",1
5215,37987,1.0,"In the past I have found Dr. Falls to be positive, helpful, and knowledgeable. However, his schedule is extremely busy (over a 6-month wait for a return appt and no waiting list). And unfortunately the admin staff is consistently unhelpful and unpleasant to deal with--as if you are bothering them when you call and they are doing you a favor to give you an appt. Honestly there are so many other good ophthalmologists in the area it is not worth the hassle of dealing with his office to continue to see him. ",1
5216,37987,1.0,Punctuality is not his strong point.  They seem to schedule multiple patients at the same time but on the plus side--he knows what he is doing.  ,1
5217,37987,1.0,my eye was infected from a work exposure and he gave me in writing a sheet that says if my eye was not better by Monday that I needed a new med perscribed. I called Monday twice and he never got back to me. Tuesday I talk to him and he blew me off and suggested over the counter drops. I called and told him again they were infected and he blew me off again. I went to another one who said they were still very infected.  Do not go to him or he will blow you off!! ,-1
5218,37988,1.0,"The only complaint I have from this practice (which made me switch practices) is the time you have to wait. I tried Dr. Porter, who is very helpful, and other doctors in the practice throughout my pregnancy, but they all make you wait too long to be seen. Some times you have to wait over an hour. The last time I had to see Dr. Fernandez I waited 1.5 hours and no one came to tell me he was runnig behind. I left without seeing Dr. Fernandez because I had to get my son from daycare. I also switched practices after that incident. I wish they could pay more attention to that issue because they are good doctors! And the staff needs to try to be LESS rude ;) and more patient! ",1
5219,37988,1.0,"Dr. Fernandez is a wonderful doctor!! But he needs to evaluate his staff, they are rude,pushy and totally OBNOXIOUS. While the dr pushes PRO-LIFE DOWN YOUR THROAT, HIS STAFF GOES TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR ABORTIONS!!!! ",1

He makes me feel like a 'friend' rather than a patient.  ",1
5222,37988,1.0,The nurses and administrative staff are extremely rude. The doctor is ok. But the practice is not that good. ,1
5223,37988,1.0,Dr. Fernandez has been my OB thorough all 4 of my pregnancies. Including one miscarriage and the last being twins. He has been very helpful and when he is uncertain of something he has always erred on the side of caution and sent me to a specialist. In fact he diagnosed my hypothyroidism after my 1st daughter was born and has always had my best interests at heart. I have recommended him highly in the past and will continue to do so.  ,1
5224,37988,1.0,"The nurses and administrative staff are extremely rude. I went to Dr. Fernandez for my 1st 2 pregnancies, one of which ended in a stillbirth and one in a miscarriage. He could have been more compassionate during this time. I was not informed of some results and did not find out about having a 2-vessel cord till I requested and read over my own history. I NEVER waited less than an hour to be seen, and on more than one occasion was there for over two hours.  ",1
5225,37988,1.0,"Dr. Fernandez delivered my 2 kids. He was fantastic - very caring, and very flexible about my particular situation. While he is not my primary doctor in that practice, I have seen him many times in the office and always amazed at how friendly he is and how he remembers me and both my kids. This is a big practice and he makes you feel like you are one of the only patients.  ",1
5226,37988,1.0,I have found Dr. Fernandez to be very helpful concerning issues surrounding menopause. He is up on the latest research and well versed in the pros and cons of HRT. I also find him very patient with questions and very open minded concerning alternative approaches. ,1
5227,37988,1.0,"In 1998 during my 6 week checkup after my son was born, Dr. Fernandez suggested I try a Depro Provera shot (despite my probable upcoming separation from my husband which occured two weeks later), stating that it was essentially the same thing as a birth control pill only injected instead of taken orally. He reasoned that it was an effective form of birth control for nursing mothers. The shot triggered migraines, and I have suffered from ever since. I also bled for 3 months after the shot wore off and had to be given a regimin of Premarin to stop the bleeding. ",-1

He has performed two surgeries on me that went very well and solved the problems they were supposed to solve.  He is conservative in his approach, and does not do unnecessary treatment or surgery.  He explains things well, offering information about available options. He and the nursing staff are very friendly.  The office moved some years ago and is much nicer than it used to be.  ",1

5232,37991,1.0,"I have gone to Dr.Falo for years.  His office staff is wonderful - they get back to you very quickly even when the office is clearly really busy.  He is extremely knowledgeable and always gives you more than one treatment option.  He has performed 3 procedures on me and I agree, VA hospital center is like checking in to a spa!  I would reccomend their office to anyone.  ",1

5235,37993,2.0,"This is a walk-in urgent care clinic, no appointment. I was pleasantly surprised to find the docs were very knowledgeable and efficient and the service while waiting was excellent. I might even make them my primary care physicians. I saw a female doctor but I think they have both genders. I moved to the area recently and didn't have a doc yet but I needed to get one quick when I got sick, so I went here, thinking it would be a one-time thing, but I really liked the service and recommend them.

5236,37994,1.0,"Had the sleep study and the sleep tech was excellent.  He had good people skills and was very knowledgable.  The building/room were very clean.  I am wondering in the other review if they were missing a tech.  The night I was there there were 2 techs and 2 people schedule at 8 and 2 more people scheduled for later.  Even if they did as the review implies, what is the big deal&#63;  While you are waiting, you can watch TV in your room.         The follow-up office visis were easy to schedule and the staff was friendly and professional.  Of the 3 or 4 I have had, on 1 was late by approximately 10 minutes.   Since the visits I have phone the office and everytime have recieved prompt profession service.   I would highly recommend this Dr and staff.  ",1
5237,37994,1.0,"The doctor was very rude and was extremely late. I was in his office for 2 hours. His office staff was unprofessional. The manager was unfriendly, and every time I came into the office she was on the phone in the back yelling and cursing on the phone. The office is old and grungy.  ",-1
5238,37995,0.0,"Dr. Fields has since moved to Washington Hospital center.  I had a very bad experience with her.  I am a BRCA 1 patient and would not recommend her for young women with the BRCA gene.  I came into her with concerns about worsening periods, weight gain, and pelvic pain.  Not only did she pass me off to her incompetent intern, she called me a 'basket case.'  I later went to a decent gynecologist who diagnosed me with PCOS.   Stay away! ",-1
5239,37995,0.0,Stay away from this doctor. She is very unprofessional. Performed surgery on me that was unnecessary and what should have been a 6-week recovery took over a year because of her lack of surgical expertise and poor follow-up care.  ,-1
5240,37995,0.0,"I was fortunate to have Dr. Fields as my surgeon in the summer of 2008.  She was highly skilled, compassionate, honest, and caring. I highly recommend her. ",1
5241,37995,0.0,Dr Fields lacked any clinical empathy and did an extremely sloppy surgical job. I have never encountered a doctor whose skill level and bedside manner were as bad as hers. She is very defensive and goes into attack mode if asked questions. I would avoid her at all costs.  ,-1

5245,37997,1.0,"Able to see me on very short notice .Seemed very knowledgeable, knows what he is doing. Did a procedure on me, no pain whatsoever. The procedure was described as somewhat unfortable. None of that. My only regret is that I lost one of my ear rings on the table.  ",1
5246,37997,1.0,"Smart, thorough and caring. He seemed skilled and compassionate. ",1
5247,37998,0.0,She makes me feel really comfortable about what can be an awkward exam.  She seems to really care about her patients as people and she takes time to answer your questions.  I recommend her highly.  ,1
5248,37998,0.0,The receptionist is fantastic.  Dr. Filak's nurse is another story all together.  She puts you on hold without waiting for a response and argues with patients about their conditions.  She's very abrasive in situations where a little bedside manner would go a long way and refused to even answer general questions about pregnancy until a blood test confirmed we were expecting.  I understand people having a bad day but she just seems to function in this impatient and rude manner no matter the day.  It's a shame because as I mentioned the receptionist is fantastic.  I haven't seen the Dr. recently enough but she's not so good to tolerate such behavior from her nurse.  Very disappointed. ,-1
5249,37998,0.0,"Dr. Filak cares about the whole person. Although the exam is basically GYN, she discusses how I'm doing in general. When I was making a decision about taking hormones, she talked me through the pros and cons and included my mental state and overall health. I feel peaceful and happy when I leave her office.  ",1
5250,37998,0.0,"I will start off by saying that I LOVE DR. FILAK, which is why I am so sad to have to leave her.  She was with me through my first two pregnancies.  She always made me feel comfortable during those uncomfortable pap exams and she is very personable. She is an extremely good doctor, and I almost feel like she is one of the family.  However, she works alone and this makes her very busy.  She has to cancel appointments frequently whenever she has deliveries or emergencies.  This is understandable, but when you have your own worries about your pregnancy, this is really troubling.  It has gotten worse over the years.  The last straw for me was when my appointment was cancelled and rescheduled many times after my miscarriage and I still never got the chance to see Dr. Filak.  I eventually gave up trying to schedule an appointment. :(  With a great deal of sadness, I am looking for a new OB/GYN who will be more available when I need her.  ",1
5251,37998,0.0,I've always had a pleasant experience at this office.  Dr. Filak is wonderful and put me at ease at my first appointment and kept me feeling optimistic when I was going through an unfortunate miscarriage.  She's attentive and compassionate.  I would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone new to the area.  I find the critical comments a complete surprise given the very positive experience I've had.  ,1
5252,37998,0.0,"Dr. Filak delivered my baby years ago. Many times in the office she was rushed and impersonal. And at one appointment the only words she spoke to me during the whole exam were to come back in a month. I left in tears feeling like garbage. Subsequent visits were better and she seemed to warm up a bit over the months. But still I hoped that out of the practice of 3 doctors (at the time) that she would not end up being the one to deliver my baby. Of course she did end up delivering my baby. And she was great! She really came through for me and saved me from needing a blood transfusion. She knows her stuff, even if she has some bad days, she is worth sticking with. ",1
5253,37999,1.0,"Good doctor, very knowledgeable and kind.  A little old fashion but I liked that about him. ",1
5254,38000,1.0,"Poor people skills, makes you wait 20-30mins in exam room. Had to go back for issues and was told to suck it up, yes he actually said that three times to me. Was very unhelpful and unprofessional.  Stay away! ",-1
5255,38001,1.0,"Dr. Falls is on of the finest doctors I have ever seen.  I have seen him for all most 15 years. And I feel so blessed that he is my doctor...your the best in my book... Cindy Carter, Salem,VA ",1
5256,38001,1.0,"I had the unfortunate role of being one of Dr. Fall's &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for Dr. Falls to begin educating himself regarding issues of the low back and spine.  I never actually agreed to see Dr. Falls; instead, at the time I arrived for appointments scheduled with another doctor, Dr. Falls would appear in the lobby and tell me he'd be seeing me.  My appointments with Dr. Falls rarely resulted in any progress, because he did not have the knowledge to suggest any useful treatments.  I could have burned my $50 co-pay and had the same end results.  :-( ",-1
5257,38001,1.0,"I love Dr. Falls. I finally started seeing him at Murray Joiner's Pain Management clinic about a year and a half ago for low back trouble and endometriosis - he is also a board certified gynecologist and a brilliant one at that. He is compassionate, caring, and stays current on the disease. He has always been honest with me and has never left me hanging when I needed his help. He is definitely a doctor you can trust. Just be up front and honest with him and he will take care of you. He chooses to help women with gynecological conditions and diseases, even though it is less profitable than delivering babies. He also is becoming very well versed in back pain and the spine, so he's not just for the ladies. He actually cares about his patients, his work - and this is so hard to find nowadays.  ",1
5258,38002,1.0,He is the best pediatrician we have ever met. It is a pity such a wonderful doctor works in a remote and not very well run practice. ,1
5259,38002,1.0,"super nice and considerate, listens and addresses concerns.  It is unfortuante such a pleasant doctor has such a poorly run office regarding appointments, or consideration to punctuality.  Each visit has been extremely long beyond a measurable reason.  This has been addressed with the doctor directly, however nothing changed.  It seemed everytime we had a visit we were made to return for another diagnosis.  Upon the return we wait and wait and wait, one would think a doctor who specializes in children would understand extended waiting. By far an office management issue and when it has been spoken to the manager or receptionist it was blown off and interestingly so, as if they did not live in the community they serve, perhaps better said, they were not worried about impressions.  Unbelievable office manager and how unprofessional.  apathy comes to mind.  ",1
5260,38003,1.0,"My skin was broken during mouth exam, but no one told me that.  When my mouth got swell and pain, I called the doctor on Friday day morning to ask for help, he told me to wait until Monday (because his office closes on Friday) without giving any treatment and apology. I have to consult other dentist for help.   I made an appointment for annual clean that support be covered 100% by insurance company, but was not given't the service that I asked for, instead I was given something else that I didn’t want, and make me to pay what they wanted. I had to pay then to it done (I was told that I have paid all I need to pay, and I do not need pay anything for next service- cleaning).  but When got additional bill from them and called to dispute the bill, his assistant was very rude.

The Farhoumand Dental facility is phenomenal, state of the art, and impeccably clean.  I felt that the staff and Dr, Farhoumand went out of their way to help me with this emergency!  They even gave me a follow up call once I got home to see how I was doing!  The integrity that Dr. Farshad Farhoumand exhibited is a rarity in today's world!

Needless to say, I have been very pleased with Dr. Imam during my visits (otherwise I would not have returned).  She always takes the time to ask how I'm doing and make sure that my medication is still appropriate.  The main reason I return to Dr. Imam, is because she is very direct in her recommendations and that is what I expect from my doctor.  I would encourage those who have a lesser opinion to be more constructive with your criticisms.  ",1

I had a good experience with the doctor and she was very kind and patient. I will remain with this doctor for as long as possible. I think that many people take her professionalism in the wrong direction, a lot of people only rate doctors when they are disappointed, not when they have been treated well. Consequently, I disagree with some of the other reviews of this doctor.  ",1

Mind you, these were minor issues that didn't require much assessment...minor issues I'd expect would be included within any general physical such as the one I had originally scheduled to see her for. After having my prescription in hand, i marched to the nearest pharmacy to get them filled only to find that she had called the pharmacy and asked that they slash my prescribed dosage by more than half, a move that was done to force me into scheduling a second appointment so i cna pay more for questions she could have clearly addressed during my first appointment and for prescriptions that only had to be prescribed once.

I have also had many billing issues with this office and not on my end, her billing specialist incorrectly filed and it took several weeks/months to clear up. The newest Front Office person she has, is very rude and extremely unfriendly. They openly discuss patients, parents, etc. in front of other patients and it's usually negative, very unprofessional.

This young lady was so rude, unprofessional and had a bad attitude on more than one occasion.  My family and I have decided we will not be going back to this doctors office UNLESS Dr. Irvine finds a better staff to work with. They are the front faces of her business and when you have to work with someone who clearly does like their job or working with others it really shows through and not something my family or I have to put up with nor should anyone else.

If you are having complicated Gastrointestinal problems which require lots of testing and exploration to diagnoses, there are high chances that he would miss it or not diagnose it. For IBS treatment he is excellent. But if you don't get relief from him, see another gastroenterologist. I had to see another one because he clearly could not diagnose it in my case.  ",-1

He likes his patients to keep diaries (which he retains) and has a sense of humor, bar none! Ask him about his &quot;Fart...&quot; book!

Lost 25 pounds, pain continued, then he told me I shouldn't be experiencing pain anymore... his assistant was rude and defensive - suggested a rigorous exercise program.

Would never put my families' health in her care again.  ",-1
5377,38035,0.0,Dr. Ivey-Crowe has a wonderful personality but thats about it. She is very kind but very loud. I could hear everything she was telling the patient in the other rooms. Her Billing dept. sucks. I have been battling with them since july of 2009 to send me a large refund check because they had me pay for my portion of their services before hand and then we had a change of insurance and the new insurance covered all of it!. Plus i was diagnosed with GDM during my pregnancy then she sent me to education at the hospital. She never asked me how that was going. They also do not have a sonogram machine in their offices and 2 physicians have left their practice since I started going there. Needless to say i am not going back. Nor am I recommending them to anyone.  ,-1
5378,38035,0.0,"Doctor Ivey Crowe is a good doctor but the practice seem too  busy to keep up with the patients.  There is always a long wait that the waiting room usually 30 minutes to 2 hours, nurses are forgetful about calling back for blood results.

My husband was equally impressed by her kindness, knowledge, and bed-side manner. She has always taken the time to answer any questions I have. Further, when I was struggling early on with a very hard pregnancy, Dr. Ivey-Crowe was the first one to find the baby's heartbeat at a very early week (8 weeks). She spent quite a bit of time with me trying to find the heart beat because she knew it would make me feel better. I would strongly recommend her to anyone I know.

The office put the wrong date of service on the claim form so they didn't get paid for the delivery of my daughter for over a year. While waiting for my insurance to pay them, they kept billing me. I had to call the insurance company every time I got a bill from them. Aetna kept telling me they rejected the claim because it was submitted incorrectly. The office took their time resubmitting. Then over a year later, when my insurance finally paid, they had the nerve to send me a bill for $2.71, esp. when they charged me $6 for every urine test I had to do during my pregnancy, something my insurance company told me they weren't supposed to. I was too lazy to look for another doctor so I went back there for my annual checkup. I had a blood test done as well and I never heard from them about the results. I called and left 3 messages but no one ever returned my call.  I am never going back there! ",-1

I call today because it's been 52 days since my last period and I NEED to find out what's going on.... no appointment for TWO WEEKS.

And the time you spend with a doctor is a matter of minutes.  I'm sad to say this, because it use to be a wonderful practice, but I wouldn't recommend them to a friend at this point.  ",1
5385,38035,0.0,The same thing happened to me as what it written below. I was disputing the fact that i was suppose to pay a delivery fee for a baby that i was going to have 8 months down the road. i told them i was going to have a repeat c section too and the billing dept woman said &quot;well that will be more&quot;.  They had no idea what they were talking about. I called my insurance company about it.  Women Physicians had it ALL wrong.  i stopped seeing them and found another dr RIGHT AWAY. no one i know had ever heard about that fee.  ,-1
5386,38035,0.0,"I am STILL waiting for a refund of my &quot;deposit for delivery&quot; charged to me last November. This practice did not deliver my baby because I ran like hell after an average of 2hr waittimes, a 5 min consult after the waittime, RUDE staff, having to chase the doc out the door to ask any questions.  So I paid for a service not rendered and have gotten the runaround for a YEAR.  I wouldn't trust this practice to draw my blood much less deliver any of my kids.  ",-1
5387,38035,0.0,"I've been going to this practice for years, and I'm sorry to say I've seen the quality of their service plummit.  Most recently, I scheduled an appointment 2 months in advance (that's the soonest they had available), and when I got there, waited for 1.5 hours to have the Dr look at my chart for literally 3 minutes and make her recommendation.  In that hour and a half, no one gave me any status updates. Sadly, this is not an isolated incident.  After 8 years and one child, I am moving on.  Between rude reception, unavailability, poor communication and scheduling, service like that is unacceptable.  I think perhaps they have not grown enough to match the increase in patients, and their service is suffering as a result.  ",-1
5388,38035,0.0,"I agree. WORST practice ever. Nothing they do seems correct. From scheduling appointments, meeting with nurses, or if you EVER get to meet with a Dr, to billing.  I have nothing but problems with them and am switching. I think they are very overwhelmed with the amount of patients and running 3 offices. Its all very sloppy. They have made what was suppose to be a happy time in my life, very stressful.  ",-1
5389,38035,0.0,"Worst Doctor Ever!  She supposedly performed a surgery to remove polyps in my uterus.  She told me I didn't have any polyps in my uterus when she got in there.  Two weeks later another doctor performed a test and said I had 5 polyps in my uterus.  Five large polyps don't appear in 2 weeks!  She then told me my uterus was scarred and  I would probably never be able to carry a child.  My new doctor checked me out, said I was fine.  Successfully carried twins full-term.   She is a horrible doctor who is sloppy and basically defrauded Aetna by charging for a medical procedure she didn't do, and they had to pay for the same surgery twice! ",-1
5390,38035,0.0,"Worst doctor/practice ever for your own peace of mind. I was using Womens Physicians of NoVa (WPNV), where this doctor practices, and got NO help during my first miscarriage. I miscarried at home and my husband tried calling the doctor-on-call but no one replied back..we had to go to the ER ourselves. I got no apologies/explanations for the lack of service, but thought it was a one-off thing and let it go. Fast forward to my second pregnancy and guess what..am 3 months along and havent spoken to a single doctor yet, no pelvic exam performed, nothing. They sent me to a specialist for a sonogram and he was shocked too that given my first mc, no doctor had spoken to me yet. Am changing to another OBGYN now, but wanted everyone to be  aware. I think they have lost some doctors in their practice and hence are short staffed.  I had to call the nurse THREE times to get the results of my first bloodwork that confirmed i was pregnant! WPNV sucks! ",-1
5391,38035,0.0,The whole practice is amazing. I recommend her to everyone. I have extremely long labors and she let me labor instead of heading right for the c-section. I was given an epidural at 1cm when I requested one. LOVE LOVE LOVE them.  ,1
5392,38035,0.0,Worst service ever. While I was pregnant with my first son she told me he had a heart defect which was incorrect. See she had misread her hand scribbled notes (from a phone call she had with lab) that stated one of the ventricle of my sons head was small in size. She thought that meant that there was a problem with the ventricle of his heart! Needless to say caused us alot fo pain & agony for a few weeks there. Also during delivery the mid wife in her practice would not give me an epidural stating I was too far along at 2 CM dilated. Found out later form other doctors that there was no reason for me not to recieve epidural! I was not given options just told how things were going to be.  ,-1
5393,38035,0.0,"Dr. Ivey-Crowe is absolutely wonderful. I probably shouldn't say that because it's already difficult to get an appointment with her because she's so busy! She keeps you laughing, all the while efficiently and skillfully going about her business. Can't recommend her high enough. ",1

Two attempts later, with a horrible &quot;toilet white&quot; front false tooth, with a huge gap to gum line later, I asked a friend who models and has the most beautiful smile who was her dentist. This was 2 years ago, and Dr Izadi, AND STAFF, provide excellent dental service. I have spent alot of money to get this right, but it is worth it to me.

She promised we could find a way to work together and we have. Yes, I would agree that she's a medication doctor. Sometimes that's what someone with a mental illness needs, and if it's not they should probably primarily  be seeing a psycologist. She listens to me and helps me keep my costs reasonable, but will insist on visits if she thinks there is a need. Our one post-partum couples councelling did not go well, but I think that was a bias towards the parient she knew. I am not a talk therapy person. The office is small and staffed only by the doctor. If you're willing to use email and text, appointments are easy to make; I have never had it take more than a week and I've had them the next day when I was in need.

She disregarded any clinical warnings about using such drugs with prior TBI history. She is very quick to push mood and personality disorders. I seriously question this practitioners capability or clinical knowledge. See this physician at your own risk. We are considering a malpractice lawsuit. Further get a second opinion if you are a current patient and if she is giving you free meds samples repeatedly you are part of a clinical trial.  ,-1

I came to her severely depressed and with severe panic attacks.  The first thing she said to me was if she couldn't help me find relief within 2 weeks she would refer me to another doctor for a second opinion...which stunned me.  But she did help and, because of my up and down mood disorder, she watches my meds very closely to make sure they are meeting my changing needs.  Being a former General Practitioner, her knowledge of meds and conditions extends beyond just physiciatry...she pushed me to get my thyroid checked and sure enough I was hypo which can cause depression.  You'll be lucky to have her!! ",1

She keeps up on the latest reseach and is receptive to information that I may find while doing my own research, as I am a VERY informed patient, and she appreciates that. She is patient and caring and returns calls within a day. I am down to seeing her every 2 months, because we finally have a drug combination that's controlling my bipolar, but if I have to see her more often, then there would be no problem. Do not judge Dr. Ibia by the first person to review her on this site. This person's rating and review is not typical, and, in fact, is highly suspect.

I mentioned why wait for something wrong to happen and its call FULL PHYSICAL why wud you focus on particular bad results. Well, i did go third time but just to pick up my report and all was well, thank god. He does nothing but ask u to come next time.

5450,38045,1.0,"I went to Dr. Iyer several times. He is rather rude and unknowledgeable. He examined me for less than two minutes. On my visits, he was very rough with the few ailments I should him. For my sprained ankle, he grabbed it, swung it around and them told me there was nothing wrong with it. It hurts to this day. In addition, any medical advice he gave me was useless. He told me my eardrum was very messed up when I showed him my tinnitus. Later he referred me to a specialist who said my eardrum looked perfectly normal. He also told me buying an electric toothbrush would stop my gums from bleeding. I bought the $100 toothbrush and nothing happened. He charges $280 per visit before insurance. His advice was useless and his demeanor was very rude. I went to him because it was close to my work, but his advice was useless and not worth the time/money.  ",-1

5456,38047,1.0,"Dr. Ingram treated me when I was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40 years old (no family history).  Dr. Ingram was very compassionate and patient and answered all of my questions.  He was very attentive to making sure I was staying as strong and comfortable as possible during my chemo treatments. Also, the nurses who administer the chemo treatments are truly angels.  They were very kind and reassuring and took great care of me.  I look forward to my follow up visits with Dr. Ingram.  Thankfully, I've been cancer free for 8 years now.  But, still worry constantly that it will come back.  Dr. Ingram gives me as much time and attention as I need to go over my test results, reassure me and encourage me that I'm okay.  Yes, I am blessed because my cancer was cured and I've been in remission for 8 years.

He had a GMC Brain Tumor and only lived 3 months. I could not believe that ANY DOCTOR would not be more compasionate to someone who had been given their death sentence. I would never recommend going to him! My father knew he didn't have long to live, but with treatments was told he had 9 - 10 months. I couldn't imagine being told I was going to die, and to have a doctor who was so obnoxious and rude! No wonder people in Winchester are going elsewhere for their chemo!

But him on a bad day was like most doctors on a normal day!  When I mentioned thinking about trying to concienve my second child at a routine well woman exam, he was so excited for me it got me excited!

My previous doctors never took the time to explain things to me. Our relationship was mainly a doctor to patient—one way. I like Dr. Jama’s bedside matters and her comprehensive healthcare approach.

Dr.Arousha together with her staff at the Elite smiles dental, took a great deal of time to educate me on my dental health and needs.

5477,38056,0.0,"I had a terrible experience with Dr. Jahangiri. The initial tooth cleaning was rushed and not very thorough. Two replacement fillings turned into two caps, a root canal and several thousand dollars worth of dental work. I was not told prior to work that there was any possibility that the two replacement fillings might lead to months of intense toothache pain, caps and rootcanals. When I became understandable anxious and upset in the dental chair, efforts to make me feel better were condescending at best. When I requested my medical records after the procedures, I was denied and had to file a charge with the Virginia Board of Dentistry. The VBoD was able to secure my records and I can now return to my trusted dentist in my old town. I wish I had read a review about Elite Smiles prior to agreeing to replace two fillings, so I thought I should write this review. Good luck with your hunt for a good dentist. They do exist, but I didn’t find them at Elite Smiles Dental.  ",-1
